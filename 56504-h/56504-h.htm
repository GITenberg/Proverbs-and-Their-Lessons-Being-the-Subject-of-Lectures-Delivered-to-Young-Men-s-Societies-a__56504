<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upcase">It</span> may be as well to state, that the lectures
which are here published were never delivered
as a complete course, but only one here and two
there, as matter gradually grew under my hands;
yet so that very much the greater part of what is
contained in this volume has been at one time or
another actually delivered. Although I have always
taken a lively interest in national proverbs, I had
no intention at the first of making a book about
them; but only selected the subject as one which
I thought, though I was not confident of this,
might afford me sufficient material for a single
lecture, which I had undertaken some time ago to
deliver. I confess that I was at the time almost
entirely ignorant of the immense number and
variety of books bearing on the subject. Many of
these I still know only by name. With some of
the best, however, I have made myself acquainted,
and by their aid, with the addition of such further
material as I could myself furnish, these lectures
have assumed their present shape; and I publish
them, because none of the works on proverbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
which I know are exactly that book for all readers
which I could have wished to see. Either they
include matter which cannot be fitly placed before
all&mdash;or they address themselves to the scholar
alone, or if not so, are at any rate inaccessible to
the mere English reader&mdash;or they contain bare
lists of proverbs, with no endeavour to compare,
illustrate, and explain them&mdash;or if they seek to
explain, yet they do it without attempting to sound
the depths, or measure the real significance, of that
which they undertake to unfold. From these or
other causes it has come to pass, that with a
multitude of books, many of them admirable, on
a subject so popular, there is no single one which
is frequent in the hands of men. I will not deny
that, with all the slightness and shortcomings of
my own, I have still hoped to supply, at least for
the present, this deficiency.</p>

<span class="stitle">THE FORM AND DEFINITION OF A PROVERB.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upcase">It</span> is very likely that from some of us proverbs
have never attracted the notice which I am persuaded
they deserve; and from this it may follow
that, when invited to bestow even a brief attention
on them, we are in some doubt whether they will
repay our pains. We think of them but as sayings
on the lips of the multitude; not a few of them
have been familiar to us as far back as we can
remember; often employed by ourselves, or in our
hearing, on slight and trivial occasions: and thus,
from these and other causes, it may very well be,
that, however sometimes one may have taken our
fancy, we yet have remained blind in the main to
the wit, wisdom, and imagination, of which they
are full; and very little conscious of the amusement,
instruction, insight, which they are capable
of yielding. Unless too we have devoted a certain
attention to the subject, we shall not be at all
aware how little those more familiar ones, which
are frequent on the lips of men, exhaust the
treasure of our native proverbs; how many and
what excellent ones remain behind, having now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
for the most part fallen out of sight; or what
riches in like kind other nations possess. We
may little guess how many aspects of interest
there are in which our own by themselves, and
our own compared with those of other people, may
be regarded.</p>

<p>And yet there is much to induce us to reconsider
our judgment, should we be thus tempted to
slight them, and to count them not merely trite,
but trivial and unworthy of a serious attention.
The fact that they please the people, and have
pleased them for ages,&mdash;that they possess so
vigorous a principle of life, as to have maintained
their ground, ever new and ever young, through
all the centuries of a nation’s existence,&mdash;nay, that
many of them have pleased not one nation only,
but many, so that they have made themselves an
home in the most different lands,&mdash;and further,
that they have, not a few of them, come down to
us from remotest antiquity, borne safely upon the
waters of that great stream of time, which has
swallowed so much beneath its waves,&mdash;all this, I
think, may well make us pause, should we be
tempted to turn away from them with anything of
indifference or disdain.</p>

<p>And then further, there is this to be considered,
that some of the greatest poets, the profoundest
philosophers, the most learned scholars, the most
genial writers in every kind, have delighted in
them, have made large and frequent use of them,
have bestowed infinite labour on the gathering and
elucidating of them. In a fastidious age, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and one of false refinement, they may go nearly or
quite out of use among the so-called upper classes.
No gentleman, says Lord Chesterfield, or “no man
of fashion,” as I think is his exact phrase, “ever
uses a proverb.”<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a>
And with how fine a touch of
nature Shakespeare makes Coriolanus, the man
who, with all his greatness, is entirely devoid of
all sympathy for the people, to utter his scorn <em>of
them</em> in scorn of their proverbs, and of their frequent
employment of these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse28">“Hang ’em!</div>
<div class="verse">They said they were an hungry, sighed forth proverbs;&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">That, <em>hunger broke stone walls</em>; that, <em>dogs must eat</em>;</div>
<div class="verse">That, <em>meat was made for mouths</em>; that, <em>the gods sent not</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>Corn for the rich men only</em>;&mdash;with these shreds</div>
<div class="verse">They vented their complainings.”</div>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse28"><cite>Coriolanus</cite>, Act <abbr title="1">I.</abbr> Sc. 1.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Aristotle collected proverbs.</div>
<p>But that they have been always dear to the
true intellectual aristocracy of a nation, there is
abundant evidence to prove. Take but these
three names in evidence, which though few, are
in themselves an host. Aristotle made a collection
of proverbs; nor did he count that he was
herein doing aught unworthy of his great reputation,
however some of his adversaries may afterwards
have made of the fact that he did so an
imputation against him. He is said to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the first collector of them, though many afterwards
followed in the same path. Shakespeare
loves them so well, that besides often citing them,
and scattering innumerable covert allusions, rapid
side glances at them, which we are in danger of
missing unless at home in the proverbs of England,
several of his plays, as <cite>Measure for Measure</cite>, <cite>All’s
well that ends well</cite>, have popular proverbs for their
titles. And <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cervantes</span>, a name only inferior to
Shakespeare, has made very plain the affection
with which he regarded them. Every reader of
<cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Don Quixote</cite> will remember his squire, who sometimes
cannot open his mouth but there drop from
it almost as many proverbs as phrases. I might
name others who have held the proverb in honour&mdash;men
who though they may not attain to these
first three, are yet deservedly accounted great; as
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plautus</span>, the most genial of Latin poets, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rabelais</span>
and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montaigne</span>, the two most original of French
authors; and how often Fuller, whom Coleridge
has styled the wittiest of writers, justifies this
praise in his witty employment of some old proverb:
and no reader can thoroughly understand
and enjoy <cite>Hudibras</cite>, none but will miss a multitude
of its keenest allusions, who is not thoroughly
familiar with the proverbial literature of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs in Scripture.</div>
<p>Nor is this all; we may with reverence adduce
quite another name than any of these, the Lord
himself, as condescending to employ such proverbs
as he found current among his people. Thus, on
the occasion of his first open appearance in the
synagogue of Nazareth, he refers to the proverb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<cite>Physician, heal thyself</cite>, (Luke <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> 23,) as one which
his hearers will perhaps bring forward against
Himself; and again presently to another, <cite>A prophet
is not without honour but in his own country</cite>,
as attested in his own history; and at the well of
Sychar He declares, “Herein is that saying,” or
that proverb, “true, <cite>One soweth and another
reapeth</cite>.” (John <abbr title="4">iv.</abbr> 37.) But He is much more
than a quoter of other men’s proverbs; He is a
maker of his own. As all forms of human composition
find their archetypes and their highest
realization in Scripture, as there is no tragedy
like Job, no pastoral like Ruth, no lyric melodies
like the Psalms, so we should affirm no proverbs
like those of Solomon, were it not that “a greater
than Solomon” has drawn out of the rich treasure
house of the Eternal Wisdom a series of proverbs
more costly still. For indeed how much of our
Lord’s teaching, especially as recorded in the three
first Evangelists, is thrown into this form; and
how many of his words have in this shape passed
over as “faithful sayings” upon the lips of men;
and so doing, have fulfilled a necessary condition
of the proverb, whereof we shall have presently to
speak.</p>

<p>But not urging this testimony any further,&mdash;a
testimony too august to be lightly used, or employed
merely to swell the testimonies of men&mdash;least
of all, men of such “uncircumcised lips” as,
with all their genius, were more than one of those
whom I have named,&mdash;and appealing only to the
latter, I shall be justified, I feel, in affirming that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
whether we listen to those single voices which
make a silence for themselves, and are heard
through the centuries and their ages, or to that
great universal voice of humanity, which is wiser
even than these (for it is these, with all else which
is worthy to be heard added to them), there is here
a subject, which those whose judgments should go
very far with us have not accounted unworthy of
their serious regard.</p>

<p>And I am sure if we bestow on them ourselves
even a moderate share of attention, we shall be
ready to set our own seal to the judgment of wiser
men that have preceded us here. For, indeed,
what a body of popular good sense and good feeling,
as we shall then perceive, is contained in the
better, which is also the more numerous, portion
of them; what a sense of natural equity, what a
spirit of kindness breathes out from many of them;
what prudent rules for the management of life,
what shrewd wisdom, which though not <em>of</em> this
world, is most truly <em>for</em> it, what frugality, what
patience, what perseverance, what manly independence,
are continually inculcated by them.
What a fine knowledge of the human heart do
many of them display; what useful, and not always
obvious, hints do they offer on many most important
points, as on the choice of companions, the
bringing up of children, the bearing of prosperity
and adversity, the restraint of all immoderate expectations.
And they take a yet higher range
than this; they have their ethics, their theology,
their views of man in his highest relations of all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
as man with his fellow man, and man with his
Maker. Be these always correct or not, and I
should be very far from affirming that they always
are so, the student of humanity, he who because
he is a man counts nothing human to be alien to
him, can never without wilfully foregoing an important
document, and one which would have
helped him often in his studies, altogether neglect
or pass them by.</p>

<div class="tbpara">
<div class="sidenote">Shortness, sense, salt.</div>
<p>But what, it may be asked, before we proceed
further, is a proverb? Nothing is harder than a
definition. While on the one hand there is for
the most part no easier task than to detect a fault
or flaw in the definitions of those who have gone
before us, nothing on the other is more difficult
than to propose one of our own, which shall not
also present a vulnerable side. Some one has said
that these three things go to the constituting of a
proverb, <em>shortness</em>, <em>sense</em>, and <em>salt</em>. In brief pointed
sayings of this kind, the second of the qualities
enumerated here, namely <em>sense</em>, is sometimes sacrificed
to alliteration. I would not affirm that it is
so here: for the words are not ill spoken, though
they are very far from satisfying the rigorous
requirements of a definition, as will be seen when
we consider what the writer intended by his three
<em>esses</em>, which it is not hard to understand. The
proverb, he would say, must have <em>shortness</em>; it
must be succinct, utterable in a breath. It must
have <em>sense</em>, not being, that is, the mere small talk
of conversation, slight and trivial, else it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
perish as soon as born, no one taking the trouble
to keep it alive. It must have <em>salt</em>, that is, besides
its good sense, it must in its manner and outward
form be pointed and pungent, having a sting in it,
a barb which shall not suffer it to drop lightly from
the memory.<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a>
Yet, regarded as a definition, this
of the triple <em>s</em> fails, as I have said; it indeed errs
both in defect and excess.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs will be concise.</div>
<p>Thus in demanding <em>shortness</em>, it errs in excess.
It is indeed quite certain that a good proverb will
be short, as short, that is, as is compatible with the
full and forcible conveying of that which it intends.
Brevity, “the soul of wit,” will be eminently
the soul of a proverb’s wit; it will contain, according
to Fuller’s definition, “much matter decocted
into few words.” Oftentimes it will consist
of two, three, or four, and these sometimes monosyllabic,
words. Thus <cite>Extremes meet</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Right
wrongs no man</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Forewarned, forearmed</cite>;&mdash;with
a thousand more.<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a>
But still shortness is only
a relative term, and it would perhaps be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>accurate to say that a proverb must be <em>concise</em>,
cut down, that is, to the fewest possible words;
condensed, quintessential wisdom.<a name="Anchor-4" id="Anchor-4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> But that, if
only it fulfil this condition of being as short as
possible, it need not be absolutely very short, there
are sufficient examples to prove. Thus <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Freytag</span>
has admitted the following, which indeed hovers
on the confines of the fable, into his great collection
of Arabic proverbs: <cite>They said to the camel-bird</cite>,
[i. e., the ostrich,] <cite>“Carry:” it answered, ‘I cannot, for I am a bird.’
They said, “Fly;” it answered,‘I cannot, for I am a camel.’</cite> This
could not be shorter, yet, as compared with the
greater number of proverbs, is not short.<a name="Anchor-5" id="Anchor-5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> Even
so the <em>sense</em> and <em>salt</em>, which are ascribed to the
proverb as other of its necessary conditions, can
hardly be said to be such; seeing that flat, saltless
proverbs, though comparatively rare, there certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>are; while yet, be it remembered, we are
not considering now what are the ornaments of a
<em>good</em> proverb, but the essential marks of all.</p>

<p>And then moreover it errs in defect; for it has
plainly omitted one quality of the proverb, and
that the most essential of all&mdash;I mean <em>popularity</em>,
acceptance and adoption on the part of the people.
Without this popularity, without these suffrages
and this consent of the many, no saying, however
brief, however wise, however seasoned with salt,
however worthy on all these accounts to have
become a proverb, however fulfilling all other its
conditions, can yet be esteemed as such. This
popularity, omitted in that enumeration of the
essential notes of the proverb, is yet the only one
whose presence is absolutely necessary, whose
absence is fatal to the claims of any saying to be
regarded as such.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aphorisms not proverbs.</div>
<p>Those, however, who have occupied themselves
with the making of collections of proverbs have
sometimes failed to realize this to themselves with
sufficient clearness, or at any rate have not kept
it always before them; and thus it has come to
pass, that many collections include whatever brief
sayings their gatherers have anywhere met with,
which to them have appeared keenly, or wisely, or
wittily spoken;<a name="Anchor-6" id="Anchor-6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a> while yet a multitude of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>have never received their adoption into the great
family of proverbs, or their rights of citizenship
therein: inasmuch as they have never passed into
general recognition and currency, have no claim to
this title, however just a claim they may have on
other grounds to our admiration and honour. For
instance, this word of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Goethe</span>’s, “A man need not
be an architect to live in an house,” seems to me
to have every essential of a proverb, saving only
that it has not passed over upon the lips of men.
It is a saying of manifold application; an universal
law is knit up in a particular example; I mean
that gracious law in the distribution of blessing,
which does not limit our use and enjoyment of
things by our understanding of them, but continually
makes the enjoyment much wider than
the knowledge; so that it is not required that one
be a botanist to have pleasure in a rose, nor a critic
to delight in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, nor a theologian to
taste all the blessings of Christian faith, nor, as he
expresses it, an architect to live in an house. And
here is an inimitable saying of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schiller</span>’s: “Heaven
and earth fight in vain against a dunce;” yet it is
not a proverb, because his alone; although abundantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
worthy to have become such;<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a> moving as it
does in the same line with, though far superior to,
the Chinese proverb, which itself also is good:
<cite>One has never so much need of his wit, as when
he has to do with a fool</cite>.</p>

<p>Or to take another example still more to the
point. James Howell, a prolific English writer of
the earlier half of the seventeenth century, one
certainly meriting better than that almost entire
oblivion into which his writings have fallen, occupied
himself much with proverbs; and besides
collecting those of others, he has himself set down
“five hundred new sayings, which in tract of time
may serve for proverbs to posterity.” As was to
be expected, they have not so done; for it is not
after this artificial method that such are born; yet
many of these proverbs in expectation are expressed
with sense and felicity; for example: “Pride is a
flower that grows in the devil’s garden;” as again,
the selfishness which characterizes too many proverbs
is not ill reproduced in the following: “Burn
not thy fingers to snuff another man’s candle;” and
there is at any rate good theology in the following:
“Faith is a great lady, and good works are her
attendants;” and in this: “The poor are God’s
receivers, and the angels are his auditors.” Yet
for all this, it would be inaccurate to quote these
as proverbs, (and their author himself, as we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>seen, did not do more than set them out as proverbs
upon trial,) inasmuch as they have remained
the private property of him who first devised them,
never having passed into general circulation; which
until men’s sayings have done, maxims, sentences,
apothegms, aphorisms they may be, and these of
excellent temper and proof, but proverbs as yet
they are not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not all proverbs true.</div>
<p>It is because of this, the popularity inherent in
a genuine proverb, that from such an one in a
certain sense there is no appeal. You will not
suppose me to intend that there is no appeal from
its wisdom, truth, or justice; from any word of
man’s there may be such; but no appeal from it,
as most truly representing a popular conviction.
Aristotle, who in his ethical and political writings
often finds very much more than this in it, always
finds this. It may not be, it very often will not be,
an universal conviction which it expresses, but ever
one popular and widespread. So far indeed from
an universal, very often over against the one proverb
there will be another, its direct antagonist;
and the one shall belong to the kingdom of light,
the other to the kingdom of darkness. <cite>Common
fame is seldom to blame</cite>; here is the baser proverb,
for as many as drink in with greedy ears all
reports to the injury of their neighbours; being
determined from the first that they <em>shall</em> be true.
But it is not left without its compensation: <cite>“They
say so,” is half a liar</cite>; here is the better word
with which <em>they</em> may arm themselves, who count
it a primal duty to close their ears against all such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
unauthenticated rumours to the discredit of their
brethren. <cite>The noblest vengeance is to forgive</cite>;
here is the godlike proverb on the manner in which
wrongs should be recompensed: <cite>He who cannot
revenge himself is weak, he who will not is vile</cite>,<a name="Anchor-8" id="Anchor-8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a>
here is the devilish. These lines occur in a sonnet
which Howell has prefixed to his collection of
proverbs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseqt">“The people’s voice the voice of God we call;</div>
<div class="verse2">And what are proverbs but the people’s voice?</div>
<div class="verse2">Coined first, and current made by common choice?</div>
<div class="verse">Then sure they must have weight and truth withal;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will follow from what has just been said, that,
true in the main, they yet cannot be taken without
certain qualifications and exceptions.<a name="Anchor-9" id="Anchor-9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Popularity essential.</div>
<p>Herein in great part the force of a proverb lies,
namely, that it has already received the stamp of
popular allowance. A man might produce, (for
what another has done, he might do again,) something
as witty, as forcible, as much to the point,
of his own; which should be hammered at the
instant on his own anvil. Yet still it is not “the
wisdom of many;” it has not stood the test of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>experience; it wants that which the other already
has, but which it only after a long period can
acquire&mdash;the consenting voice of many and at
different times to its wisdom and truth. A man
employing a “proverb of the ancients,” (1 <abbr title="Samarians">Sam.</abbr>
<abbr title="24">xxiv.</abbr> 13,) is not speaking of his own, but uttering
a faith and conviction very far wider than that of
himself or of any single man; and it is because he
is so doing that they, in Lord Bacon’s words,
“serve not only for ornament and delight, but also
for active and civil use; as being the edge tools of
speech which cut and penetrate the knots of
business and affairs.” The proverb has in fact
the same advantage over the word now produced
for the first time, which for present currency and
value has the recognised coin of the realm over the
rude unstamped ore newly washed from the stream,
or dug up from the mine. This last <em>may</em> possess
an equal amount of fineness; but the other has
been stamped long ago, has already passed often
from man to man, and found free acceptance with
all:<a name="Anchor-10" id="Anchor-10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a>
it inspires therefore a confidence which the
ruder metal cannot at present challenge. And the
same satisfaction which the educated man finds in
referring the particular matter before him to the
universal law which rules it, a plainer man finds in
the appeal to a proverb. He is doing the same
thing; taking refuge, that is, as each man so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>gladly does, from his mere self and single fallible
judgment, in a larger experience and in a wider
conviction.</p>

<p>And in all this which has been urged lies, as it
seems to me, the explanation of a sentence of an
ancient grammarian, which at first sight appears to
contain a bald absurdity, namely, that a proverb
is “a saying without an author.” For, however
without a <em>known</em> author it may, and in the majority
of cases it must be, still, as we no more believe
in the spontaneous generation of proverbs than of
anything else, an author every one of them must
have had. It might, however, and it often will
have been, that in its utterance the author did but
<em>precipitate</em> the floating convictions of the society
round him; he did but clothe in happier form
what others had already felt, or even already
uttered; for often a proverb has been in this
aspect, “the wit of one, and the wisdom of many.”
And further, its constitutive element, as we must
all now perceive, is not the utterance on the part
of the one, but the acceptance on the part of the
many. It is <em>their</em> sanction which first makes it to
be such; so that every one who took or gave it
during the period when it was struggling into
recognition may claim to have had a share in its
production; and in this sense without any single
author it may have been. From the very first the
people will have vindicated it for their own. And
thus though they do not always analyse the compliment
paid to them in the use of their proverbs,
they always feel it; they feel that a writer or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
speaker using these is putting himself on their
ground, is entering on their region, and they
welcome him the more cordially for this.<a name="Anchor-11" id="Anchor-11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a></p>

<div class="tbpara">
<div class="sidenote">Not all proverbs figurative.</div>
<p>Let us now consider if some other have not
sometimes been proposed as essential notes of the
proverb, which yet are in fact accidents, such as
may be present or absent without affecting it
vitally. Into an error of this kind they have
fallen, who have claimed for the proverb, and
made it one of its necessary conditions, that it
should be a figurative expression. A moment’s
consideration will be sufficient to disprove this.
How many proverbs, such as <cite>Haste makes waste</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Honesty
is the best policy</cite>, with ten thousand
more, have nothing figurative about them. Here
again the error has arisen from taking that which
belongs certainly to very many proverbs, and those
oftentimes the best and choicest, and transferring
it, as a necessary condition, to all. This much
of truth they who made the assertion certainly
had; namely, that the employment of the concrete
instead of the abstract is one of the most frequent
means by which it obtains and keeps its popularity;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>for so the proverb makes its appeal to the whole
man&mdash;not to the intellectual faculties alone, but to
the feelings, to the fancy, or even to the imagination,
as well, stirring the whole man to pleasurable
activity.</p>
</div>

<p>By the help of an instance or two we can best
realize to ourselves how great an advantage it
thus obtains for itself. Suppose, for example, one
were to content himself with saying, “He may wait
till he is a beggar, who waits to be rich by other
men’s deaths,” would this trite morality be likely to
go half so far, or to be remembered half so long,
as the vigorous comparison of this proverb: <cite>He
who waits for dead men’s shoes may go barefoot</cite>?<a name="Anchor-12" id="Anchor-12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a>
Or again, what were “All men are mortal,” as
compared with the proverb: <cite>Every door may be
shut but death’s door</cite>? Or let one observe:
“More perish by intemperance than are drowned
in the sea,” is this anything better than a painful,
yet at the same time a flat, truism? But let it be
put in this shape: <cite>More are drowned in the beaker
than in the ocean</cite>;<a name="Anchor-13" id="Anchor-13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> or again in this: <cite>More are
drowned in wine and in beer than in water</cite>;<a name="Anchor-14" id="Anchor-14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a>
(and these both are German proverbs,) and the
assertion assumes quite a different character. There
is something that lays hold on us now. We are
struck with the smallness of the cup as set against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>the vastness of the ocean, while yet so many more
deaths are ascribed to that than to this; and further
with the fact that literally none are, and none
could be, drowned in the former, while multitudes
perish in the latter. In the justifying of the paradox,
in the extricating of the real truth from the apparent
falsehood of the statement, in the answer to the
appeal made here to the imagination,&mdash;an appeal
and challenge which, unless it be responded to, the
proverb must remain unintelligible to us,&mdash;in all
this there is a process of mental activity, oftentimes
so rapidly exercised as scarcely to be perceptible,
yet not the less carried on with a pleasurable
excitement.<a name="Anchor-15" id="Anchor-15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rhyme in proverbs.</div>
<p>Let me mention now a few other of the more
frequent helps which the proverb employs for obtaining
currency among men, for being listened to
with pleasure by them, for not slipping again from
their memories who have once heard it;&mdash;yet helps
which are evidently so separable from it, that none
can be in danger of affirming them essential parts
or conditions of it. Of these rhyme is the most
prominent. It would lead me altogether from my
immediate argument, were I to enter into a disquisition
on the causes of the charm which rhyme
has for us all; but that it does possess a wondrous
charm, that we <em>like</em> what is <em>like</em>, is attested by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
thousand facts, and not least by the circumstance
that into this rhyming form a very great multitude
of proverbs, and those among the most widely
current, have been thrown. Though such will probably
at once be present to the minds of all, yet let
me mention a few: <cite>Good mind, good find</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Wide
will wear, but tight will tear</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Truth may be
blamed, but cannot be shamed</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Little strokes fell
great oaks</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Women’s jars breed men’s wars</cite>;&mdash;<cite>A
king’s face should give grace</cite>;&mdash;<cite>East, west, home
is best</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Store is no sore</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Slow help is no
help</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Who goes a-borrowing, goes a-sorrowing</cite>;&mdash;with
many more, uniting, as you will observe
several of them do, this of rhyme with that which I
have spoken of before, namely, extreme brevity
and conciseness.<a name="Anchor-16" id="Anchor-16"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Alliteration in proverbs.</div>
<p>Alliteration, which is nearly allied to rhyme, is
another of the helps whereof the proverb largely
avails itself. Alliteration was at one time an important
element in our early English versification;
it almost promised to contend with rhyme itself,
which should be the most important; and perhaps,
if some great master in the art had arisen, might
have retained a far greater hold on English poetry
than it now possesses. At present it is merely
secondary and subsidiary. Yet it cannot be called
altogether unimportant; no master of melody
despises it; on the contrary, the greatest, as in
our days Tennyson, make the most frequent, though
not always the most obvious, use of it. In the
proverb you will find it of continual recurrence,
and where it falls, as, to be worth anything, it
must, on the key-words of the sentence, of very
high value. Thus: <cite>Frost and fraud both end in
foul</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Like lips, like lettuce</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Meal and matins
minish no way</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Who swims in sin, shall sink
in sorrow</cite>;&mdash;<cite>No cross, no crown</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Out of debt,
out of danger</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Do in hill as you would do in
hall</cite>;<a name="Anchor-17" id="Anchor-17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a>
that is, Be in solitude the same that you
would be in a crowd. I will not detain you with
further examples of this in other languages; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>such occur, and in such numbers that it seems idle
to quote them, in all; I will only adduce, in concluding
this branch of the subject, a single Italian
proverb, which in a remarkable manner unites all
three qualities of which we have been last treating,
brevity, rhyme, and alliteration: <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Traduttori, traditori</cite>;
one which we might perhaps reconstitute
in English thus: <cite>Translators, traitors</cite>; so untrue,
for the most part, are they to the genius of their
original, to its spirit, if not to its letter, and
frequently to both; so do they <em>surrender</em>,
rather than <em>render</em>, its meaning; not <em>turning</em>,
but only <em>overturning</em>, it from one language to
another.<a name="Anchor-18" id="Anchor-18"></a><a href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a></p>

<p>A certain pleasant exaggeration, the use of the
figure hyperbole, a figure of natural rhetoric which
Scripture itself does not disdain to employ, is a
not unfrequent engine with the proverb to procure
attention, and to make a way for itself into the
minds of men. Thus the Persians have a proverb:
<cite>A needle’s eye is wide enough for two friends;
the whole world is too narrow for two foes</cite>.
Again, of a man whose good luck seems never to
forsake him, so that from the very things which
would be another man’s ruin he extricates himself
not merely without harm, but with credit and
with gain, the Arabs say: <cite>Fling him into the
Nile, and he will come up with a fish in his mouth</cite>;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>while of such a Fortunatus as this the Germans
have a proverb: <cite>If he flung a penny on the
roof, a dollar would come down to him</cite>;<a name="Anchor-19" id="Anchor-19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> as,
again, of the man in the opposite extreme of
fortune, to whom the most unlikely calamities,
and such as beforehand might seem to exclude
one another, befall, they say: <cite>He would fall on
his back, and break his nose</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Transplanting of proverbs.</div>
<p>In all this which I have just traced out, in the
fact that the proverbs of a language are so frequently
its highest bloom and flower, while yet so
much of their beauty consists often in curious
felicities of diction pertaining exclusively to some
single language, either in a rapid conciseness to
which nothing tantamount exists elsewhere, or in
rhymes which it is hard to reproduce, or in alliterations
which do not easily find their equivalents,
or in other verbal happinesses such as these, lies
the difficulty which is often felt, which I shall
myself often feel in the course of these lectures, of
transferring them without serious loss, nay, sometimes
the impossibility of transferring them at all
from one language to another.<a name="Anchor-20" id="Anchor-20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a>
Oftentimes, to

wines, (I believe the Spanish <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Valdepeñas</span> is one,)
of which the true excellence can only be known
by those who drink them in the land which gave
them birth. Transport them under other skies,
or, which is still more fatal, empty them from
vessel to vessel, and their strength and flavour will
in great part have disappeared in the process.</p>

<p>Still this is rather the case, where we seek
deliberately, and only in a literary interest, to
translate some proverb which we admire from its
native language into our own or another. Where,
on the contrary, <em>it has transferred itself</em>, made for
itself a second home, and taken root a second
time in the heart and affections of a people, in
such a case one is continually surprised at the instinctive
skill with which it has found compensations
for that which it has been compelled to
let go; it is impossible not to admire the unconscious
skill with which it has replaced one vigorous
idiom by another, one happy rhyme or play
on words by its equivalent; and all this even in
those cases where the extremely narrow limits in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>which it must confine itself allow it the very
smallest liberty of selection. And thus, presenting
itself equally finished and complete in two or even
more languages, the internal evidence will be quite
insufficient to determine which of its forms we
shall regard as the original, and which as a copy.
For example, the proverb at once German and
French, which I can present in no comelier
English dress than this,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Mother’s truth</div>
<div class="verse">Keeps constant youth;</div>
</div>

<p>but which in German runs thus,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse"><cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours se renouvelle</cite>;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>appears to me as exquisitely graceful and tender
in the one language as in the other; while yet so
much of its beauty depends on the form, that
beforehand one could hardly have expected that
the charm of it would have survived its transfer
to the second language, whichever that may be,
wherein it found an home. Having thus opened
the subject, I shall reserve its further development
for the lectures which follow.</p>

 So, too, in other languages; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui prend, se rend;&mdash; Qui
se loue, s’emboue</span>;&mdash; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Chi và piano, và sano, e và lontano;&mdash;
Chi compra terra, compra guerra</span>;&mdash;<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Quien se muda,

Latin medieval;&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qualis vita, finis ita;&mdash;Via crucis, via
lucis;&mdash;Uniti muniti</span>.&mdash;We sometimes regard rhyme as a
modern invention, and to the modern world no doubt the
discovery of all its capabilities, and the consequent large
application of it belongs. But proverbs alone would be
sufficient to show that in itself it is not modern, however
restricted in old times the employment of it may have been.
For instance, there is a Greek proverb to express that men
learn by their sufferings more than by any other teaching:
<ins title="Greek: Pathêmata mathêmata"><span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Παθήματα, μαθήματα</span></ins> (<abbr title="Herodotus">Herod.</abbr>, <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> 207;) one which in the
Latin, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nocumenta, documenta</span>, or, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæ nocent, docent</span>,
finds both in rhyme and sense its equivalent; to both of
which evidently the inducement lay in the chiming and
rhyming words. Another rhyming Greek proverb which
I have met, <ins title="Greek: Plêsmonê, epilêsmonê"><span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Πλησμονή, ἐπιλησμονὴ</span></ins>, implying that fulness of
blessings is too often accompanied with forgetfulness of
their Author (<cite><abbr title= "Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr></cite> 8. 11–14,) is, I fancy, not ancient&mdash;at
least does not date further back than Greek Christianity.
The sentiment would imply this, and the fact that the word
<ins title="Greek: epilêsmonê"><span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ἐπιλησμονή</span></ins> does not occur in classical Greek would seem
to be decisive upon it.</p></li>

<span class="stitle">THE GENERATION OF PROVERBS.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upcase">In</span> my preceding lecture I occupied your attention
with the form and definition of a proverb;
let us proceed in the present to realize to ourselves,
so far as this may be possible, the processes by
which a nation gets together the great body of
its proverbs, the sources from which it mainly
derives them, and the circumstances under which
such as it makes for itself of new, had their birth
and generation.</p>

<p>And first, I would call to your attention the
fact that a vast number of its proverbs a people
does not make for itself, but finds ready made to
its hands: it enters upon them as a part of its
intellectual and moral inheritance. The world
has now endured so long, and the successive generations
of men have thought, felt, enjoyed, suffered,
and altogether learned so much, that there is an
immense stock of wisdom which may be said to
belong to humanity in common, being the gathered
fruits of all this its experience in the past. Even
Aristotle, more than two thousand years ago, could
speak of proverbs as “the fragments of an elder
wisdom, which, on account of their brevity and
aptness, had amid a general wreck and ruin been
preserved.” These, the common property of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
civilized world, are the original stock with which
each nation starts; these, either orally handed
down to it, or made its own by those of its earlier
writers who brought it into living communication
with the past. Thus, and through these channels, a
vast number of Greek, Latin, and medieval proverbs
live on with us, and with all the modern nations
of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Antiquity of proverbs.</div>
<p>It is, indeed, oftentimes a veritable surprise to
discover the venerable age and antiquity of a
proverb, which we have hitherto assumed to be
quite a later birth of modern society. Thus we
may perhaps suppose that well-known word which
forbids the too accurate scanning of a present,
<cite>One must not look a gift horse in the mouth</cite>, to
be of English extraction, the genuine growth of our
own soil. I will not pretend to say how old it may
be, but it is certainly as old as Jerome, a Latin
father of the fourth century; who, when some
found fault with certain writings of his, replied
with a tartness which he could occasionally exhibit,
that they were voluntary on his part, free-will
offerings, and with this quoted the proverb, <cite>that
it did not behove to look a gift horse in the mouth</cite>;
and before it comes to us, we meet it once more in
one of the rhymed Latin verses, which were such
great favourites in the middle ages:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si quis dat mannos, ne quære in dentibus annos</span>.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, <cite>Liars should have good memories</cite> is a
saying which probably we assume to be modern;
yet it is very far from so being. The same Jerome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
who, I may observe by the way, is a very great
quoter of proverbs, and who has preserved some
that would not otherwise have descended to us,<a name="Anchor-22" id="Anchor-22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a>
speaks of one as “unmindful of the <em>old</em> proverb,
<cite>Liars should have good memories</cite>,”<a name="Anchor-23" id="Anchor-23"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a> and we find it
ourselves in a Latin writer a good deal older than
him.<a name="Anchor-24" id="Anchor-24"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a>
So too I was certainly surprised to discover
the other day that our own proverb: <cite>Good company
on a journey is worth a coach</cite>, has come down to
us from the ancient world.<a name="Anchor-25" id="Anchor-25"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rhymed Latin proverbs.</div>
<p>Having lighted just now on one of those Latin
rhymed verses, let me by the way guard against an
error about them, into which it would be very easy
to fall. I have seen it suggested that these, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the source <em>from</em> which, are yet the channels <em>by</em>
which, a great many proverbs have reached us.
I should greatly doubt it. This much we may
conclude from the existence of proverbs in this
shape, namely, that since these rhymed or leonine
verses went altogether out of fashion at the revival
of a classical taste in the fifteenth century,
such proverbs as are found in this form may be
affirmed with a tolerable certainty to date at least
as far back as that period; but not that in all or
even in a majority of cases, this shape was their
earliest. Oftentime the proverb in its more popular
form is so greatly superior to the same in this its
Latin monkish dress, that the latter by its tameness
and flatness betrays itself at once as the inadequate
translation, and we cannot fail to regard the other
as the genuine proverb. Many of them are “so
essentially Teutonic, that they frequently appear to
great disadvantage in the Latin garb which has been
huddled upon them.”<a name="Anchor-26" id="Anchor-26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a>
Thus, when we have on
one side the English, <cite>Hungry bellies have no ears</cite>,
and on the other the Latin,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jejunus venter non audit verba libenter</span>,</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>who can doubt that the first is the proverb, and the
second only its versification? Or who would hesitate
to affirm that the old Greek proverb, <cite>A rolling
stone gathers no moss</cite>, may very well have come
to us without the intervention of the medieval
Latin,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non fit hirsutus lapis hinc atque inde volutus</span>?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>And the true state of the case comes out still more
clearly, where there are <em>two</em> of these rhymed Latin
equivalents for the one popular proverb, and these
quite independent of each other. So it is in respect
of our English proverb: <cite>A bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush</cite>; which appears in this
form:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Una avis in dextrâ melior quam quatuor extra</span>;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and also in this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capta avis est pluris quam mille in gramine ruris</span>.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Who can fail to see here two independent attempts
to render the same saying? Sometimes the Latin
line confesses itself to be only the rendering of a
popular word; thus is it with the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut dicunt multi, cito transit lancea stulti</cite>;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>in other words: <cite>A fool’s bolt is soon shot</cite>.</p>

<p>Then, besides this derivation from elder sources,
from the literature of nations which as such now
no longer exist, besides this process in which a
people are merely receivers and borrowers, there is
also at somewhat later periods in its life a mutual
interchange between it and other nations growing
up beside, and cotemporaneously with it, of their
own several inventions in this kind; a free giving
and taking, in which it is often hard, and oftener
impossible, to say which is the lender and which
the borrower. Thus the quantity of proverbs not
drawn from antiquity, but common to all, or nearly
all of the modern European languages, is very
great. The ‘solidarity’ (to use a word which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs claimed by many.</div>
<p>There is indeed nothing in the study of proverbs,
in the attribution of them to their right owners,
in the arrangement and citation of them, which
creates a greater perplexity than the circumstances
of finding the same proverb in so many different
quarters, current among so many different nations.
In quoting it as of one, it often seems as if we
were doing wrong to many, while yet it is almost,
or oftener still altogether, impossible to determine
to what nation it first belonged, so that others
drew it at second hand from that one;&mdash;even granting
that any form in which we now possess it is
really its oldest of all. More than once this fact
has occasioned a serious disappointment to the
zealous collector of the proverbs of his native
country. Proud of the rich treasures which in this
kind it possessed, he has very reluctantly discovered
on a fuller investigation of the whole subject, how
many of these which he counted native, the peculiar
heirloom and glory of his own land, must at once
and without hesitation be resigned to others, who
can be shown beyond all doubt to have been in
earlier possession of them: while in respect of
many more, if his own nation can put in a claim
to them as well as others, yet he is compelled to
feel that it can put in no better than, oftentimes
not so good as, many competitors.<a name="Anchor-27" id="Anchor-27"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>This single fact, which it is impossible to question,
that nations are thus continually borrowing
proverbs from one another, is sufficient to show
that, however the great body of those which are
the portion of a nation may be, some almost as old
as itself, and some far older, it would for all this
be a serious mistake to regard the sum of them as
a closed account, neither capable of, nor actually receiving,
addition&mdash;a mistake of the same character
as that sometimes made in regard to the <em>words</em> of
a language. So long as a language is living, it
will be appropriating foreign words, putting forth
new words of its own. Exactly in the same way,
so long as a people have any vigorous energies at
work in them, are acquiring any new experiences
of life, are forming any new moral convictions, for
the new experiences and convictions new utterances
will be found; and some of the happiest of
these will receive that stamp of general allowance
which shall constitute them proverbs. And this
fact makes it little likely that the collections which
exist in print, and certainly not the earlier ones,
will embrace all the proverbs in actual circulation.
They preserve, indeed, many others; all those which
have now become obsolete, and which would, but
for them, have been forgotten; but there are not
a few, as I imagine, which, living on the lips of
men, have yet never found their way into books,
however worthy to have done so; and this, either
because the sphere in which they circulate has
continued always a narrow one, or that the occasions
which call them out are very rare, or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Unregistered proverbs.</span>
they, having only lately risen up, have not hitherto
attracted the attention of any who cared to record
them. It would be well, if such as take an interest
in the subject, and are sufficiently well versed in
the proverbial literature of their own country to
recognise such unregistered proverbs when they
meet them, would secure them from that perishing,
which, so long as they remain merely oral,
might easily overtake them; and would make
them at the same time, what all <em>good</em> proverbs
ought certainly to be, the common heritage of all.<a name="Anchor-28" id="Anchor-28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>And as new proverbs will be born from life and
from life’s experience, so too there will be another
fruitful source of their further increase, namely, the
books which the people have made heartily their
own. Portions of these they will continually
detach, most often word for word; at other times
wrought up into new shapes with that freedom
which they claim to exercise in regard of whatever
they thus appropriate to their own use. These,
having detached, they will give and take as part of
their current intellectual money. Thus “<cite>Evil communications
corrupt good manners</cite>,”<a name="Anchor-29" id="Anchor-29"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> (1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Cor.</abbr> <abbr title="15">xv.</abbr>
33,) is word for word a metrical line from a Greek
comedy. It is not probable that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul had ever
read this comedy, but the words for their truth’s
sake had been taken up into the common speech of
men; and not as a citation, but as a proverb, he uses
them. And if you will, from this point of view,
glance over a few pages of one of Shakespeare’s
more popular dramas,&mdash;Hamlet, for example,&mdash;you
will be surprised, in case your attention has
never been called to this before, to note how much
has in this manner been separated from it, that it
might pass into the every day use and service of
man; and you will be prepared to estimate higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
than ever what he has done for his fellow countrymen,
the “possession for ever” which his writings
have become for them. And much no doubt is
passing even now from favourite authors into the
flesh and blood of a nation’s moral and intellectual
life; and as “household words,” as parts of its
proverbial philosophy, for ever incorporating itself
therewith. We have a fair measure of an author’s
true popularity, I mean of the real and lasting
hold which he has taken on his nation’s heart, in
the extent to which it has been thus done with
his writings.</p>

<div class="tbpara">
<p>There is another way in which additions are
from time to time made to the proverbial wealth
of a people. Some event has laid strong hold of
their imagination, has stirred up the depths of their
moral consciousness; and this they have gathered
up for themselves, perhaps in some striking phrase
which was uttered at the moment, or in some
allusive words, understood by everybody, and which
at once summon up the whole incident before their
eyes.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Scriptural proverbs.</div>
<p>Sacred history furnishes us with one example
at the least of the generation in this wise of a
proverb. That word, “<cite>Is Saul also among the
prophets?</cite>” is one of which we know the exact
manner in which it grew to be a “proverb in Israel.”
When the son of Kish revealed of a sudden that
nobler life which had hitherto been slumbering in
him, alike undreamt of by himself and by others,
took his part and place among the sons of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
prophets, and, borne along in their enthusiasm,
praised and prophesied as they did, showing that
he was indeed turned into another man, then all
that knew him beforehand said one to another,
some probably in sincere astonishment, some in
irony and unbelief, “Is Saul also among the
prophets?” And the question they asked found
and finds its application so often as any reveals of
a sudden, at some crisis of his life, qualities for
which those who knew him the longest had hitherto
given him no credit, a nobleness which had been
latent in him until now, a power of taking his
place among the worthiest and the best, which
none until now had at all deemed him to possess.
It will, of course, find equally its application, when
one does not step truly, but only affects suddenly
to step, into an higher school, to take his place in
a nobler circle of life, than that in which hitherto
he has moved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cranes of Ibycus.</div>
<p>Another proverb, and one well known to the
Greek scholar, <cite>The cranes of Ibycus</cite>,<a name="Anchor-30" id="Anchor-30"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a> had its rise
in one of those remarkable incidents, which, witnessing
for God’s inscrutable judgments, are eagerly
grasped by men. The story of its birth is indeed
one to which so deep a moral interest is attached,
that I shall not hesitate to repeat it, even at the
risk that <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schiller</span>’s immortal poem on the subject,
or it may be the classical studies of some here
present, may have made it already familiar to a
portion of my hearers. Ibycus, a famous lyrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
poet of Greece, journeying to Corinth, was assailed
by robbers: as he fell beneath their murderous
strokes he looked round, if any witnesses or avengers
were nigh. No living thing was in sight,
save only a flight of cranes soaring high over head.
He called on them, and to them committed the
avenging of his blood. A vain commission, as it
might have appeared, and as no doubt it did to
the murderers appear. Yet it was not so. For
these, sitting a little time after in the open theatre
at Corinth, beheld this flight of cranes hovering
above them, and one said scoffingly to another,
“Lo, there, the avengers of Ibycus!” The words
were caught up by some near them; for already
the poet’s disappearance had awakened anxiety
and alarm. Being questioned, they betrayed themselves,
and were led to their doom; and <cite>The cranes
of Ibycus</cite> passed into a proverb, very much as our
<cite>Murder will out</cite>, to express the wondrous leadings
of God whereby continually the secretest
thing of blood is brought to the open light of day.</p>

<p><cite>Gold of Toulouse</cite><a name="Anchor-31" id="Anchor-31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a>
is another of these proverbs
in which men’s sense of a God verily ruling and
judging the earth has found its embodiment. The
Consul Q. S. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cæpio</span> had taken the city of Toulouse
by an act of more than common perfidy and
treachery; and possessed himself of the immense
hoards of wealth stored in the temples of the Gaulish
deities. From this day forth he was so hunted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
calamity, all extremest evils and disasters, all shame
and dishonour, fell so thick on himself and all
who were his, and were so traced up by the moral
instinct of mankind to this accursed thing which he
had made his own, that any wicked gains, fatal to
their possessor, acquired this name; and of such a
one it would be said “He has gold of Toulouse.”</p>

<p>Another proverb, which in English has run into
the following posy, <cite>There’s many a slip ’twixt the
cup and the lip</cite>, descends to us from the Greeks,
having a very striking story connected with it:
A master treated with extreme cruelty his slaves
who were occupied in planting and otherwise laying
out a vineyard for him; until at length one of
them, the most misused, prophesied that for this his
cruelty he should never drink of its wine. When
the first vintage was completed, he bade this slave
to fill a goblet for him, which taking in his hand
he at the same time taunted him with the non-fulfilment
of his prophecy. The other replied with
words which have since become proverbial: as he
spake, tidings were hastily brought of a huge wild
boar that was wasting the vineyard. Setting
down the untasted cup, the master went out to
meet the wild boar, and was slain in the encounter,
and thus the proverb, <cite>Many things find place
between the cup and lip</cite>, arose.<a name="Anchor-32" id="Anchor-32"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a></p>

<p>A Scotch proverb, <cite>He that invented the Maiden,
first hanselled it</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
is not altogether unworthy to
rank with these. It alludes to the well-known
historic fact that the Regent Morton, the inventor
of a new instrument of death called “The Maiden,”
was himself the first upon whom the proof of it
was made. Men felt, to use the language of the
Latin poet, that “no law was juster than that the
artificers of death should perish by their own art,”
and embodied their sense of this in the proverb.</p>

<p>Memorable words of illustrious men will frequently
not die in the utterance, but pass from
mouth to mouth, being still repeated with complacency,
till at length they have received their
adoption into the great family of national proverbs.
<span class="sidenote">Gnomes become proverbs.</span>
Such were the gnomes or sayings of the Seven
Wise Men of Greece, supposing them to have been
indeed theirs, and not ascribed to them only after
they had obtained universal currency and acceptance.
So too a saying, attributed to Alexander
the Great, may very well have arisen on the occasion,
and under the circumstances, to which its
birth is commonly ascribed. When some of his
officers reported to him with something of dismay
the innumerable multitudes of the Persian hosts
which were advancing to assail him, the youthful
Macedonian hero silenced them and their apprehensions
with the reply: <cite>One butcher does not
fear many sheep</cite>; not in this applying an old
proverb, but framing a new, and one admirably
expressive of the confidence which he felt in the
immeasurable superiority of the Hellenic over the
barbarian man;&mdash;and this word, having been once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
set on foot by him, has since lived on, and that,
because the occasions were so numerous on which
a word like this would find its application.</p>

<p>And taking occasion from this royal proverb, let
me just observe by the way, that it would be a
great mistake to assume, though the error is by no
means an uncommon one, that because proverbs
are popular, they have therefore originally sprung
from the bosom of the populace. What was urged
in my first lecture of their popularity was not at
all intended in this sense; and the sound common
sense, the wit, the wisdom, the right feeling, which
are their <em>predominant</em> characteristics, alike contradict
any such supposition. They spring rather
from the sound healthy kernel of the nation, whether
in high place or in low; and it is surely worthy of
note, how large a proportion of those with the
generation of which we are acquainted, owe their
existence to the foremost men of their time, to its
philosophers, its princes, and its kings; as it would
not be difficult to show. And indeed the evil in
proverbs testifies to this quite as much as the good.
Thus the many proverbs in almost all modern
tongues expressing scorn of the “villain” are alone
sufficient to show that for the most part they are
very far from having their birth quite in the lower
regions of society, but reflect much oftener the
prejudices and passions of those higher in the
social scale.</p>

<p>Let me adduce another example of the proverbs
which have thus grown out of an incident, which
contain an allusion to it, and are only perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">A Spanish proverb.</span>
intelligible when the incident itself is known. It
is this Spanish: <cite>Let that which is lost be for God</cite>;
one the story of whose birth is thus given by the
leading Spanish commentator on the proverbs of
his nation:&mdash;The father of a family, making his
will and disposing of his goods upon his death-bed,
ordained concerning a certain cow which had
strayed, and had been now for a long time missing,
that, if it were found, it should be for his children,
if otherwise for God: and hence the proverb, <cite>Let
that which is lost be for God</cite>, arose. The saying
was not one to let die; it laid bare with too fine a
skill some of the subtlest treacheries of the human
heart; for, indeed, whenever men would give to
God only their lame and their blind, that which
costs them nothing, that from which they hope no
good, no profit, no pleasure for themselves, what
are they saying in their hearts but that which this
man said openly, <cite>Let that which is lost be for God</cite>.</p>

<p>This subject of the generation of proverbs, upon
which I have thus touched so slightly, is yet one
upon which whole volumes have been written.
Those who have occupied themselves herein have
sought to trace historically the circumstances out of
which various proverbs have sprung, and to which
they owe their existence; that so by the analogy of
these we might realize to ourselves the rise of others
whose origins lie out of our vision, obscure and
unknown. No one will deny the interest of the
subject: it cannot but be most interesting to preside
thus at the birth of a saying which has lived
on and held its ground in the world, and has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
ceased, from the day it was first uttered, to be
more or less of a spiritual or intellectual force
among men. Still the cases where this is possible
are exceedingly rare, as compared with the far
greater number where the first birth is veiled, as is
almost all birth, in mystery and obscurity. And
indeed it could scarcely be otherwise. The great
majority of proverbs are foundlings, the happier
foundlings of a nation’s wit, which the collective
nation has refused to let perish, has taken up and
adopted for its own. But still, as must be expected
to be the case with foundlings, they can for the
most part give no distinct account of themselves.
They make their way, relying on their own merits,
not on those of their parents and authors; whom
they have forgotten; and who seem equally to
have forgotten them, or, at any rate, fail to claim
them. Not seldom, too, when a story has been
given to account for a proverb’s rise, it must remain
a question open to much doubt, whether the story
has not been subsequently imagined for the proverb,
rather than that the proverb has indeed
sprung out of history.<a name="Anchor-33" id="Anchor-33"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a></p>

<div class="tb para">
<p>The proverb having thus had its rise from life,
however it may be often impossible to trace that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>rise, will continually turn back to life again; it
will attest its own practical character by the frequency
with which it will present itself for use, and
will have been actually used upon earnest and
<span class="sidenote">Employment of proverbs.</span>
important occasions; throwing its weight into one
scale or the other at some critical moment, and
sometimes with decisive effect. I have little doubt
that with knowledge sufficient one might bring
together a large collection of instances wherein, at
significant moments, the proverb has played its
part, and, it may be, very often helped to bring
about issues, of which all would acknowledge the
importance.</p>
</div>

<p>In this aspect, as having been used at a great
critical moment, and as part of the moral influence
brought to bear on that occasion for effecting a
great result, no proverb of man’s can be compared
with that one which the Lord used when He met
his future Apostle, but at this time his persecutor,
in the way, and warned him, of the fruitlessness and
folly of a longer resistance to a might which must
overcome him, and with still greater harm to himself,
at the last: <cite>It is hard for thee to kick against
the pricks</cite>.<a name="Anchor-34" id="Anchor-34"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> (Acts <abbr title="26">xxvi.</abbr> 14.) It is not always
observed, but yet it adds much to the fitness of
this proverb’s use on this great occasion, that it
was already, even in that heathen world to which
originally it belonged, predominantly used to note
the madness of a striving on man’s part against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
superior power of the gods; for so we find it in
the chief passages of heathen antiquity in which it
occurs.<a name="Anchor-35" id="Anchor-35"></a><a href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a></p>

<p>I must take the second illustration of my assertion
from a very different quarter, passing at a
single stride from the kingdom of heaven to the
kingdom of hell, and finding my example there.
We are told then, that when Catherine de Medicis
desired to overcome the hesitation of her son Charles
the Ninth, and draw from him his consent to the
massacre, afterwards known as that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew,
she urged on him with effect a proverb
which she had brought with her from her own land,
and assuredly one of the most convenient maxims
for tyrants that was ever framed: <cite>Sometimes
clemency is cruelty, and cruelty clemency</cite>.</p>

<p>Later French history supplies another and more
agreeable illustration. At the siege of Douay, Louis
the Fourteenth found himself with his suite unexpectedly
under a heavy cannonade from the besieged
city. I do not believe that Louis was
deficient in personal courage, yet, in compliance
with the entreaties of most of those around him,
who urged that he should not expose so important
a life, he was about, in somewhat unsoldierly and
unkingly fashion, immediately to retire; when <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Charost</span>, drawing close to him, whispered the
well-known French proverb in his ear: <cite>The wine
is drawn; it must be drunk</cite>.<a name="Anchor-36" id="Anchor-36"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> The king remained
exposed to the fire of the enemy a suitable
period, and it is said ever after held in higher honour
than before the counsellor who had with this word
saved him from an unseemly retreat. Let this on
the generation of proverbs, with the actual employment
which has been made of them, for the
present suffice.</p>

 The pages of the excellent <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> would
no doubt be open to receive such, and in them they might
be safely garnered up. That there are such proverbs to
reward him who should carefully watch for them, is
abundantly proved by the immense addition, which, as I
shall have occasion hereafter to mention, a Spanish scholar
was able to make to the collected proverbs, so numerous
before, of Spain. Nor do there want other indications of
the like kind. Thus, the editor of very far the best modern
collection of German proverbs, records this one, found, as
he affirms, in no preceding collection, and by himself
never heard but once, and then from the lips of an aged
lay servitor of a monastery in the Black Forest: <cite>Offend
one monk, and the lappets of all cowls will flutter as far
as Rome</cite>; (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beleidigestu einen Münch, so knappen alle
Kuttenzipfel bis nach Rom</span>;) and yet who can doubt that
we have a genuine proverb here, and one excellently expressive
of the common cause which the whole of the
monastic orders, despite their inner dissensions, made ever,
when assailed from without, with one another? It is very
easy to be deceived in such a matter, and one must be content
often to be so; but the following, which is current in
Ireland, I have never seen in print: “<cite>The man on the dyke
always hurls well</cite>;” the looker-on at a game of hurling,
seated indolently on the wall, always imagines that he
could improve on the strokes of the actual players, and,
if you will listen to him, would have played the game
much better than they; a proverb of sufficiently wide
application.</p></li>

<span class="stitle">THE PROVERBS OF DIFFERENT NATIONS COMPARED.</span></h2>



<p class="cap"><span class="upcase">“The</span> genius, wit, and spirit of a nation are
discovered in its proverbs,”&mdash;this is Lord
Bacon’s well-worn remark; although, indeed, only
well-worn because of its truth. “In them,” it has
been further said, “is to be found an inexhaustible
source of precious documents in regard of
the interior history, the manners, the opinions, the
beliefs,<a name="Anchor-37" id="Anchor-37"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a>
the customs of the people among whom
they have had their course.”<a name="Anchor-38" id="Anchor-38"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a>
Let us put these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
assertions to the proof, and see how far in this
people’s or in that people’s proverbs, their innermost
<span class="sidenote">Proverbs characteristic.</span>
heart speaks out to us; how far the comparison
of the proverbs of one nation with those of
others may be made instructive to us; what this
comparison will tell us severally about each. This
only I will ask, ere we enter upon the subject,
that if I should fail here in drawing out anything
strongly characteristic, if the proverbs regarded
from this point of view should not seem to reveal
to you any of the true secrets of national life, you
will not therefore misdoubt those assertions with
which my lecture opened; or assume that these
documents would not yield up their secret, if questioned
aright; but only believe that the test has
been unskilfully applied; or, if you will, that my
brief limits have not allowed me to make that
clear, which with larger space I might not have
wholly failed in doing.</p>

<p>I am very well aware that in following upon
this track, one is ever liable to deceive oneself, to
impose upon others, picking out and adducing such
proverbs as conform to a preconceived theory,
passing over those which would militate against it.
Quite allowing that there is such a danger which
needs to be guarded against, and also that there
are a multitude of these sayings which cannot be
made to illustrate difference, for they rest on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
broad foundation of the universal humanity, underlying
and deeper than that which is peculiar
and national, I am yet persuaded that enough remain,
and such as may with perfect good faith be
adduced, to confirm these assertions; I am convinced
that we <em>may</em> learn from the proverbs current
among a people, what is nearest and dearest to
their hearts, the aspects under which they contemplate
life, how honour and dishonour are distributed
among them, what is of good, what of evil
report in their eyes, with very much more which it
can never be unprofitable to know.</p>

<div class="tbpara">
<p>To begin, then, with the proverbs of Greece.
That which strikes one most in the study of these,
and which the more they are studied, the more fills
the thoughtful student with wonder, is the evidence
they yield of a leavening through and through of
the entire nation with the most intimate knowledge
of its own mythology, history, and poetry. The
infinite multitude of slight and fine allusions to the
legends of their gods and heroes, to the earlier
incidents of their own history, to the Homeric narrative,
the delicate side glances at all these which
the Greek proverbs constantly embody,<a name="Anchor-39" id="Anchor-39"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> assume
an acquaintance, indeed a familiarity, with all this
on their parts among whom they passed current,
which almost exceeds belief. In many and most
important respects, the Greek proverbs considered
as a whole are inferior to those of many nations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>modern Christendom. This is nothing wonderful;
Christianity would have done little for the world,
would have proved very ineffectual for the elevating,
purifying, and deepening of man’s life, if it had
been otherwise. But, with all this, as bearing
testimony to the high intellectual training of the
people who employed them, to a culture not restricted
to certain classes, but which must have been
diffused through the whole nation, no other collection
can bear the remotest comparison with this.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Roman proverbs.</div>
<p>It is altogether different with the Roman proverbs.
These, the genuine Roman, the growth of
their own soil, are very far fewer in number than
the Greek, as was indeed to be expected from the
far less subtle and less fertile genius of the people.
Hardly any of them are legendary or mythological;
which again agrees with the fact that the Italian
pantheon was very scantily peopled as compared
with the Greek. Very few have much poetry
about them, or any very rare delicacy or refinement
of feeling. In respect of love indeed, not
the Roman only, but Greek and Roman alike, are
immeasurably inferior to those which many modern
nations could supply. Thus a proverb of
such religious depth and beauty as our own, <cite>Marriages
are made in heaven</cite>, it would have been
quite impossible for all heathen antiquity to have
produced, or even remotely to have approached.<a name="Anchor-40" id="Anchor-40"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p>In the setting out not of love, but of friendship,
and of the claims which it makes, the blessings
which it brings, is exhibited whatever depth and
tenderness they may have.<a name="Anchor-41" id="Anchor-41"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a> This indeed, as has
been truly observed,<a name="Anchor-42" id="Anchor-42"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a> was only to be expected,
seeing how much higher an ideal of that existed
than of this, the full realization of which was reserved
for the modern Christian world. Yet the
Roman proverbs are not without other substantial
merits of their own. A vigorous moral sense
speaks out in many;<a name="Anchor-43" id="Anchor-43"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a> and even when this is not
so prominent, they wear often a thoroughly old
Roman aspect; being business-like and practical,
frugal and severe, wise saws such as the elder
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cato</span> must have loved, such as must have been
often upon his lips;<a name="Anchor-44" id="Anchor-44"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> while in the number that
relate to farming, they bear singular witness to that
strong and lively interest in agricultural pursuits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
which was so remarkable a feature in the old Italian
life.<a name="Anchor-45" id="Anchor-45"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Number of Spanish proverbs.</div>
<p>It will not be possible to pass under even this
hastiest review more than two or three of the
modern families of proverbs. Let us turn first to
the proverbs of Spain. I put these in the foremost
rank, because the Spanish literature, poor in many
provinces wherein other literatures are rich, is probably
richer in this province than any other in the
world, certainly than any other in the western
world; and this I should be inclined to believe,
both as respects the quantity and the quality.<a name="Anchor-46" id="Anchor-46"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a>
In respect of quantity, the mere number of Spanish
proverbs is astonishing. A collection I have been
using while preparing these lectures, contains
between seven and eight thousand, and yet does
not contain all; for I have searched it in vain for
several with which from other sources I had become
acquainted. Nay, it must be very far indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
from exhausting the entire stock, seeing that there
exists a manuscript collection brought together by
a distinguished Spanish scholar, in which the proverbs
have attained to the almost incredible amount
of from five and twenty to thirty thousand.<a name="Anchor-47" id="Anchor-47"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish characteristics.</div>
<p>And in respect of their quality, it needs only
to call to mind some of those, so rich in humour,
so double-shotted with homely sense, wherewith
the Squire in <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Don Quixote</cite> adorns his discourse;
being oftentimes indeed not the fringe and border,
but the main woof and texture of it: and then, if
we assume that the remainder are not altogether
unlike these, we shall, I think, feel that it would
be difficult to rate them more highly than they
deserve. And some are in a loftier vein; for taking,
as we have a right to do, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cervantes</span> himself as the
truest exponent of the Spanish character, we
should be prepared to trace in the proverbs of
Spain a grave thoughtfulness, a stately humour,
to find them breathing the very spirit of chivalry
and honour, and indeed of freedom too;&mdash;for in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Spain, as throughout so much of Europe, it is
despotism, and not freedom, which is new. Nor
are we disappointed in these our expectations.
How eminently chivalresque, for instance, the following:
<cite>White hands cannot hurt</cite>.<a name="Anchor-48" id="Anchor-48"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a> What a grave
humour lurks in this: <cite>The ass knows well in
whose face he brays</cite>.<a name="Anchor-49" id="Anchor-49"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a> What a stately apathy,
how proud a looking of calamity in the face, speaks
out in the admonition which this one contains:
<cite>When thou seest thine house in flames, approach
and warm thyself by it</cite>;<a name="Anchor-50" id="Anchor-50"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a> what a spirit of freedom,
which refuses to be encroached on even by
the highest, is embodied in another: <cite>The king
goes as far as he may, not as far as he would</cite>;<a name="Anchor-51" id="Anchor-51"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a>
what Castilian pride in the following: <cite>Every layman
in Castile might make a king, every clerk a
pope</cite>. The Spaniard’s contempt for his peninsular
neighbours finds its emphatic utterance in another:
<cite>Take from a Spaniard all his good qualities,
and there remains a Portuguese</cite>.</p>

<p>We may too, I think, remark how a nation will
occasionally in its proverbs indulge in a fine irony
upon itself, and show that it is perfectly aware of
its own weaknesses, follies, and faults. This the
Spaniards must be allowed to do in their proverb,
<cite>Succours of Spain, either late, or never</cite>.<a name="Anchor-52" id="Anchor-52"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a> However
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>largely and confidently promised, these <em>succours
of Spain</em> either do not arrive at all, or only
arrive after the opportunity in which they could
have served have passed away. Certainly any one
who reads the despatches of England’s Great Captain
during the Peninsular War will find in almost
every page of them that which abundantly justifies
this proverb, will own that those who made it read
themselves aright, and could not have designated
broken pledges, unfulfilled promises of aid, tardy
and thus ineffectual assistance, by an happier title
than <cite>Succours of Spain</cite>. And then again what a
fearful glimpse of those blood feuds which, having
once begun, seem as if they could never end, blood
touching blood, and violence evermore provoking
its like, have we in the following: <cite>Kill, and thou
shalt be killed, and they shall kill him who kills
thee</cite>.<a name="Anchor-53" id="Anchor-53"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a></p>

<p>The Italians also are eminently rich in proverbs;
and yet if ever I have been tempted to retract or
seriously to modify what I shall have occasion by-and-bye
to affirm in regard of a nobler life and
spirit as predominating in proverbs, it has been
after the study of some Italian collection. “The
Italian proverbs,” it has been said not without too
much reason, though perhaps also with overmuch
severity, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
“have taken a tinge from their deep and
politic genius, and their wisdom seems wholly
concentrated in their personal interests. I think
every tenth proverb in an Italian collection is some
cynical or some selfish maxim, a book of the world
for worldlings.”<a name="Anchor-54" id="Anchor-54"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a> Certainly many of them are
shrewd enough, and only too shrewd; “ungracious,”
inculcating an universal suspicion, teaching
to look everywhere for a foe, to expect, as the
Greeks said, a scorpion under every stone, glorifying
artifice and cunning as the true guides and
only safe leaders through the perplexed labyrinth
of life,<a name="Anchor-55" id="Anchor-55"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a> and altogether seeming dictated as by the
very spirit of Machiavel himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs on revenge.</div>
<p>And worse than this is the glorification of revenge
which speaks out in too many of them. I
know nothing of its kind calculated to give one a
more shuddering sense of horror than the series
which might be drawn together of Italian proverbs
on this matter; especially when we take
them with the commentary which Italian history
supplies, and which shows them no empty words,
but the deepest utterances of the nation’s heart.
There is no misgiving in these about the right of
entertaining so deadly a guest in the bosom; on
the contrary, one of them, exalting the sweetness
of revenge, declares, <cite>Revenge is a morsel for God</cite>.<a name="Anchor-56" id="Anchor-56"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a>
There is nothing in them, (it would be far better
if there were,) of blind and headlong passion, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
rather a spirit of deliberate calculation, which
makes the blood run cold. Thus one gives this
advice: <cite>Wait time and place to act thy revenge,
for it is never well done in a hurry</cite>;<a name="Anchor-57" id="Anchor-57"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a> while another
proclaims an immortality of hatred, which
no spaces of intervening time shall have availed to
weaken: <cite>Revenge of an hundred years old hath
still its sucking teeth</cite>.<a name="Anchor-58" id="Anchor-58"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> We may well be thankful
that we have in England, at least as far as I am
aware, no sentiments parallel to these, embodied as
the permanent convictions of the national mind.</p>

<p>How curious again is the confession which speaks
out in another Italian proverb, that the maintenance
of the Romish system and the study of
Holy Scripture cannot go together. It is this:
<cite>With the Gospel one becomes an heretic</cite>.<a name="Anchor-59" id="Anchor-59"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> No doubt
with the study of the Word of God one does become
an heretic, in the Italian sense of the word;
and therefore it is only prudently done to put all
obstacles in the way of that study, to assign three
years’ and four years’ imprisonment with hard
labour to as many as shall dare to peruse it; yet
certainly it is not a little remarkable that such a
confession should have embodied itself in the
popular utterances of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Italian proverbs.</div>
<p>But while it must be freely owned that the
charges brought just now against the Italian proverbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
are sufficiently borne out by too many, they
are not all to be included in the common shame.
Very many there are not merely of a delicate
refinement of beauty, as this, expressive of the
freedom in regard of <em>thine</em> and <em>mine</em> which will
exist between true friends: <cite>Friends tie their purses
with a spider’s thread</cite>;<a name="Anchor-60" id="Anchor-60"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a> of a subtle wisdom which
has not degenerated into cunning and deceit; but
also of a nobler stamp; honour and honesty, plain
dealing and uprightness, have here their praises
too, and are not seldom pronounced to be in the
end more than a match for all cunning and deceit.
How excellent in this sense is the following:
<cite>For an honest man half his wits is enough, the
whole are too little for a knave</cite>;<a name="Anchor-61" id="Anchor-61"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a> the ways, that is,
of truth and uprightness are so simple and plain,
that a little wit is abundantly sufficient for those
that walk in them; the ways of falsehood and fraud
are so perplexed and tangled, that sooner or later
all the wit of the cleverest rogue will not preserve
him from being entangled therein. How often and
how wonderfully has this found its confirmation
in the lives of evil men; so true it is, to employ
another proverb and a very deep one from the
same quarter, that <cite>The devil is subtle, yet weaves
a coarse web</cite>.<a name="Anchor-62" id="Anchor-62"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, what description of Egypt as it now is,
or indeed generally of the East, could set us at
the heart of its moral condition, could make us to
understand all which long centuries of oppression
and misrule have made of it and of its people, what
could do this so effectually as the collection of
Arabic proverbs now current in Egypt, which the
traveller Burckhardt gathered, and which, after his
death, were published with his name?<a name="Anchor-63" id="Anchor-63"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a> In other
books, others describe the modern Egyptians, but
here they unconsciously describe themselves. The
selfishness, the utter extinction of all public spirit,
the servility, which no longer as with an inward
shame creeps into men’s acts, but utters itself
boldly as the avowed law of their lives, the sense
of the oppression of the strong, of the insecurity of
the weak, and, generally, the whole character of life,
alike outward and inward, as poor, mean, sordid,
and ignoble, with only a few faintest glimpses of
that romance which one usually attaches to the
East; all this, as we study these documents, rises up
before us in truest, though in painfullest, outline.</p>

<p>Thus only in a land where rulers, being evil themselves,
feel all goodness to be their instinctive foe,
and themselves therefore entertain an instinctive
hostility to it, where they punish but never reward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
where not to be noticed by them is the highest
ambition of those under their yoke, in no other
land could a proverb like the following, <cite>Do no
good, and thou shalt find no evil</cite>, have ever come
to the birth. How settled a conviction that wrong,
and not right, was the lord paramount of the world
must have grown up in men’s spirits, before such a
word as this, (I know of no sadder one,) could have
found utterance from their lips.<a name="Anchor-64" id="Anchor-64"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Irish proverb.</div>
<p>I have taken a wide circuit of nations; with the
proverb of a people nearer home I must bring
this branch of the subject to an end. It is one,
and a very characteristic one, which the poet
Spenser, who long dwelt in Ireland, records as
current in his time among the Irish; in which
were contained their offer of service to their native
chiefs, with a statement of what they expected in
return: <cite>Spend me, and defend me</cite>. Their leaders
in all times have taken them only too well at their
word in respect of the first half of the proverb,
and have not failed prodigally to <em>spend</em> them;
although their undertakings to <em>defend</em> have issued
exactly as must ever issue all promises on the part
of others to defend men from those evils, from
which none can really protect them but themselves.</p>

<div class="tb para">
<p>Other families of proverbs would each of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
tell its own tale, give up its own secret; but I
must not seek from this point of view to question
them further. I would rather bring now to your
notice that even where they do not spring, as they
cannot all, from the centre of a people’s heart, nor
declare to us the secretest things which are there,
but dwell more on the surface of things, in this
case also they have often local or national features,
which to study and trace out may prove both
curious and instructive. Of how many, for example,
we may note the manner in which they clothe themselves
in an outward form and shape, borrowed
from, or suggested by, the peculiar scenery or circumstances
or history of their own land; so that
they could scarcely have come into existence, not
certainly in the shape which they now wear, anywhere
besides. Thus our own, <cite>Make hay while
the sun shines</cite>, is truly English, and could have
had its birth only under such variable skies as
ours,&mdash;not, at any rate, in those southern lands
where, during the summer time at least, the sun
always shines. In the same way there is a fine
Cornish proverb in regard of obstinate wrongheads,
who will take no counsel except from calamities,
who dash themselves to pieces against obstacles,
which with a little prudence and foresight they
might easily have avoided. It is this: <cite>He who
will not be ruled by the rudder, must be ruled by
the rock</cite>. It sets us at once upon some rocky and
wreck-strewn coast; we feel that it could never
have been the proverb of an inland people. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
this, <cite>Do not talk Arabic in the house of a Moor</cite>,<a name="Anchor-65" id="Anchor-65"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a>&mdash;that
is, because there thy imperfect knowledge
will be detected at once,&mdash;this we should confidently
affirm to be Spanish, wherever we met it. So also
a traveller with any experience in the composition
of Spanish sermons and Spanish <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ollas</span> could make
no mistake in respect of the following: <cite>A sermon
without Augustine is as a stew without bacon</cite>.<a name="Anchor-66" id="Anchor-66"></a>

<a href="#Footnote-67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a>
could have its home only in Germany; that enormous
vessel, known as the Heidelberg tun, constructed
to contain nearly 300,000 flasks, having
now stood empty for hundreds of years. As regards,
too, the following, <cite>Not every parish-priest can
wear Dr. Luther’s shoes</cite>,<a name="Anchor-68" id="Anchor-68"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a> we could be in no doubt
to what people it appertains. And this, <cite>The world
is a carcase, and they who gather round it are
dogs</cite>, plainly proclaims itself as belonging to those
Eastern lands, where the unowned dogs prowling
about the streets of a city are the natural scavengers,
that would assemble round a carcase thrown in the
way. So too the form which our own proverb,
<cite>Man’s extremity, God’s opportunity</cite>, or as we
sometimes have it, <cite>When need is highest, help is
nighest</cite> assumes among the Jews, namely this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<cite>When the tale of bricks is doubled, Moses comes</cite>,<a name="Anchor-69" id="Anchor-69"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a>
plainly roots itself in the early history of that
nation, being an allusion to <abbr title="Exodus">Exod.</abbr> <abbr title="5">v.</abbr> 9–19, and
without a knowledge of that history would be
unintelligible altogether. The same may be said
of this: <cite>We must creep into Ebal, and leap into
Gerizim</cite>; in other words, we must be slow to curse,
and swift to bless. (<abbr title= "Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr> <abbr title="27">xxvii.</abbr> 12, 13.)</p>
</div>

<p>But while it is thus with some, which are bound
by the very conditions of their existence to a narrow
and peculiar sphere, or at all events move more
naturally and freely in it than elsewhere, there are
others on the contrary which we meet all the
world over. True cosmopolites, they seem to have
travelled from land to land, and to have made
themselves an home equally in all. The Greeks
obtained them probably from the older East, and
again imparted them to the Romans; and from
these they have found their way into all the
languages of the western world.</p>

<p>Much, I think, might be learned from knowing
what those truths are, which are so felt to be true
by all nations, that all have loved to possess them
in these compendious forms, wherein they may
pass readily from mouth to mouth: which, thus
cast into some happy form, have commended themselves
to almost all people, and have become a
portion of the common stock of the world’s wisdom,
in every land making for themselves a recognition
and an home. Such a proverb, for instance, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<cite>Man proposes, God disposes</cite>;<a name="Anchor-70" id="Anchor-70"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a> one which I am
inclined to believe that every nation in Europe
possesses, so deeply upon all men is impressed the
sense of Hamlet’s words, if not the words themselves:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseqt">“There’s a divinity that <em>shapes</em> our ends,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Rough-hew</em> them how we will.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs compared.</div>
<p>Sometimes the proverb does not actually in so
many words repeat itself in various tongues. We
have indeed exactly the same <em>thought</em>; but it takes
an outward shape and embodiment, varying according
to the various countries and periods in which
it has been current: we have proverbs totally
diverse from one another in their form and appearance,
but which yet, when we look a little deeper
into them, prove to be at heart one and the same,
all these their differences being thus only, so to
speak, variations of the same air. These are almost
always an amusing, often an instructive, study;
and to trace this likeness in difference has an
interest lively enough. Thus the <em>forms</em> of the
proverb, which brings out the absurdity of those
reproving others for a defect or a sin, to whom the
same cleaves in an equal or in a greater degree,
have sometimes no visible connexion at all, or the
very slightest, with one another; yet for all this
the proverb is at heart and essentially but one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
We say in English: <cite>The kiln calls the oven,
“Burnt house;”</cite>&mdash;the Italians: <cite>The pan says to
the pot “Keep off, or you’ll smutch me;”</cite><a name="Anchor-71" id="Anchor-71"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a>&mdash;the
Spaniards: <cite>The raven cried to the crow, “Avaunt,
blackamoor;”</cite><a name="Anchor-72" id="Anchor-72"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a>&mdash;
the Germans: <cite>One ass nicknames
another, Long-ears</cite>;<a name="Anchor-73" id="Anchor-73"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a>&mdash;
while it must be owned there
is a certain originality in the Catalan version of
the proverb: <cite>Death said to the man with his
throat cut, “How ugly you look.”</cite> Under how
rich a variety of forms does one and the same
thought array itself here.</p>

<p>Let me quote another illustration of the same
fact. We probably take for granted that <cite>Coals to
Newcastle</cite> is a thoroughly English expression of the
absurdity of sending to a place that which already
abounds there, water to the sea, faggots to the
wood:&mdash;and English of course it is in the outward
garment which it wears; but in its innermost being
it belongs to the whole world and to all times.
Thus the Greeks said: <cite>Owls to Athens</cite>,<a name="Anchor-74" id="Anchor-74"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a> Attica
abounding with these birds; the Rabbis: <cite>Enchantments
to Egypt</cite>, Egypt being of old esteemed the
head quarters of all magic; the Orientals: <cite>Pepper
to Hindostan</cite>; and in the middle ages they had
this proverb: <cite>Indulgences to Rome</cite>, Rome being
the centre and source of this spiritual traffic; and
these by no means exhaust the list.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Various proverbs.</div>
<p>Let me adduce some other variations of the same
descriptions, though not running through quite so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
many languages. Thus compare the German, <cite>Who
lets one sit on his shoulders, shall have him presently
sit on his head</cite>,<a name="Anchor-75" id="Anchor-75"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a> with the Italian, <cite>If thou
suffer a calf to be laid on thee, within a little
they’ll clap on the cow</cite>,<a name="Anchor-76" id="Anchor-76"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a> and, again, with the
Spanish, <cite>Give me where I may sit down; I will
make where I may lie down</cite>.<a name="Anchor-77" id="Anchor-77"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> They all three
plainly contain one and the same hint that undue
liberties are best resisted at the outset, being otherwise
liable to be followed up by other and greater
ones; but this under how rich and humorous a
variety of forms. Not very different are these that
follow. We say: <cite>Daub yourself with honey, and
you’ll be covered with flies</cite>; the Danes: <cite>Make
yourself an ass, and you’ll have every man’s sack
on your shoulders</cite>; while the French: <cite>Who makes
himself a sheep, the wolf devours him</cite>;<a name="Anchor-78" id="Anchor-78"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a> and the
Persians: <cite>Be not all sugar, or the world will
gulp thee down</cite>;<a name="Anchor-79" id="Anchor-79"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a> to which they add, however, as
its necessary complement, <cite>nor yet all wormwood,
or the world will spit thee out</cite>. Or again, we are
content to say without a figure: <cite>The receiver’s as
bad as the thief</cite>; but the French: <cite>He sins as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
who holds the sack, as he who puts into it</cite>;<a name="Anchor-80" id="Anchor-80"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a> and
the Germans: <cite>He who holds the ladder is as guilty
as he who mounts the wall</cite>.<a name="Anchor-81" id="Anchor-81"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a> We say: <cite>A stitch in
time saves nine</cite>; the Spaniards: <cite>Who repairs not
his gutter, repairs his whole house</cite>.<a name="Anchor-82" id="Anchor-82"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a> We say:
<cite>Misfortunes never come single</cite>; the Italians have
no less than three proverbs to express the same
popular conviction: <cite>Blessed is that misfortune
which comes single</cite>; and again: <cite>One misfortune is
the vigil of another</cite>; and again: <cite>A misfortune and
a friar are seldom alone</cite>.<a name="Anchor-83" id="Anchor-83"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a> Or once more, the
Russians say: <cite>Call a peasant, “Brother,” he’ll
demand to be called, “Father;”</cite> the Italians:
<cite>Reach a peasant your finger, he’ll grasp your
fist</cite>.<a name="Anchor-84" id="Anchor-84"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a> Many languages have this proverb: <cite>God
gives the cold according to the cloth</cite>;<a name="Anchor-85" id="Anchor-85"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> it is very
beautiful, but attains not to the tender beauty of
our own: <cite>God tempers the wind to the shorn
lamb</cite>.</p>

<p>And, as in that last example, so not seldom will
there be an evident superiority of a proverb in
one language over one, which however resembles it
closely in another. Moving in the same sphere, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>will yet be richer, fuller, deeper. Thus our own,
<cite>A burnt child fears the fire</cite>, is good; but that of
many tongues, <cite>A scalded dog fears cold water</cite>, is
better still. Ours does but express that those who
have suffered once will henceforward be timid in
respect of that same thing from which they have
suffered; but that other the tendency to exaggerate
such fears, so that now they shall fear even
where no fear is. And the fact that so it will be,
clothes itself in an almost infinite variety of forms.
Thus one Italian proverb says: <cite>A dog which has
been beaten with a stick, is afraid of its shadow</cite>;
and another, which could only have had its birth in
the sunny South, where the glancing but harmless
lizard so often darts across your path: <cite>Whom
a serpent has bitten a lizard alarms</cite>.<a name="Anchor-86" id="Anchor-86"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a> With
a little variation from this, the Jewish Rabbis had
said long before: <cite>One bitten by a serpent, is afraid
of a rope’s end</cite>; even that which bears so remote
a resemblance to a serpent as this does, shall now
inspire him with terror; and the Cingalese, still
expressing the same thought, but with imagery
borrowed from their own tropic clime: <cite>The man
who has received a beating from a firebrand, runs
away at sight of a firefly</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rabbinical proverb.</div>
<p>Some of our Lord’s sayings contain the same
lessons which the proverbs of the Jewish Rabbis
contained already; for He was willing to bring
forth even from his treasury things old as well as
new; but it is very instructive to observe how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
acquire in his mouth a dignity and decorum which,
it may be, they wanted before. We are all familiar
with that word in the Sermon on the Mount,
“Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go
with him twain.” The Rabbis had a proverb to
match, lively and piquant enough, but certainly
lacking the gravity of this, and which never could
have fallen from the same lips: <cite>If thy neighbour
call thee ass, put a packsaddle on thy back</cite>; do
not, that is, withdraw thyself from the wrong,
but rather go forward to meet it. But thus, in
least as in greatest, it was His to make all things
new.</p>

<p>Sometimes a proverb, without changing its shape
altogether, will yet on the lips of different nations
be slightly modified; and these modifications,
slight as often they are, may not the less be
eminently characteristic. Thus in English we say,
<span class="sidenote">Progress of ingratitude.</span>
<cite>The river past, and God forgotten</cite>, to express with
how mournful a frequency He whose assistance
was invoked, it may have been earnestly, in the
moment of peril, is remembered no more, so soon
as by his help the danger has been surmounted.
The Spaniards have the proverb too; but it is with
them: <cite>The river past, the saint forgotten</cite>,<a name="Anchor-87" id="Anchor-87"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a> the
saints being in Spain more prominent objects of
invocation than God. And the Italian form of it
sounds a still sadder depth of ingratitude: <cite>The
peril past, the saint mocked</cite>;<a name="Anchor-88" id="Anchor-88"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a> the vows made to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
him in peril remaining unperformed in safety;
and he treated something as, in Greek story, Juno
was treated by Mandrabulus the Samian; who,
having under her auspices and through her direction
discovered a gold mine, in his instant
gratitude vowed to her a golden ram; which he
presently exchanged in intention for a silver one;
and again this for a very small brass one; and
this for nothing at all; the rapidly descending
scale of whose gratitude, with the entire disappearance
of his thank-offering, might very profitably
live in our memories, as so perhaps it would be
less likely to repeat itself in our lives.</p>

The writer might have added, the superstitions; for
proverbs not a few involve and rest on popular superstitions,
and a collection of these would be curious and in
many ways instructive. Such, for instance, is the Latin,
(it is, indeed, also Greek): <cite>A serpent, unless it devour a
serpent, grows not to a dragon</cite>; (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Serpens, nisi serpentem
comederit, non fit draco</span>); which Lord Bacon moralizes so
shrewdly: “The folly of one man is the fortune of another;
for no man prospers so suddenly as by other men’s errors.”
Such again is the old German proverb: <cite>The night is no
man’s friend</cite>; (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Nacht ist keines Menschen Freund</span>;)
which rests, as <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grimm</span> has so truly observed (<abbr title="Deutsche Mythologie"><cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche
Mythol.</cite></abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 713) on the wide-spread feeling in the northern
mythologies, of the night as an unfriendly and, indeed,
hostile power to man. And such, too, the French: <cite>A
Sunday’s child dies never of the plague</cite>; (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui nait le

Jeremy Taylor appears to have found much delight
in the proverbs of Italy. In the brief foot notes which he
has appended to the <cite>Holy Living</cite> alone I counted five and
twenty such, to which he makes more or less remote allusion
in the text. There is an excellent article on “Tuscan
Proverbs” in <cite>Fraser’s Magazine</cite>, Jan. 1857.</p></li>

<span class="stitle">THE POETRY, WIT, AND WISDOM OF PROVERBS.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upcase">It</span> will be my endeavour in the three lectures
which I have still to deliver to justify the
attention which I have claimed on behalf of proverbs
from you, not merely by appealing to the
authority of others, who at different times have
prized and made much of them, but by bringing
out and setting before you, so far as I have the
skill to do it, some of the merits and excellencies
by which they are mainly distinguished. Their
wit, their wisdom, their poetry, the delicacy, the
fairness, the manliness which characterize so many
of them, their morality, their theology, will all by
turns come under our consideration. Yet shall I
beware of presenting them to you as though they
embodied these nobler qualities only. I shall not
keep out of sight that there are proverbs, coarse,
selfish, unjust, cowardly, profane; “maxims” wholly
undeserving of the honour implied by that name.<a name="Anchor-89" id="Anchor-89"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a>
Still as my pleasure, and I doubt not yours, is
rather in the wheat than in the tares, I shall,
while I do not conceal this, prefer to dwell in the
main on the nobler features which they present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Poetic imagery.</div>
<p>And first, in regard of the poetry of proverbs&mdash;whatever
is <em>from</em> the people, or truly <em>for</em> the people,
whatever either springs from their bosom, or has
been cordially accepted by them, still more whatever
unites both these conditions, will have poetry,
imagination, in it. For little as the people’s
craving after wholesome nutriment of the imaginative
faculty, and after an entrance into a fairer
and more harmonious world than that sordid and
confused one with which often they are surrounded,
is duly met and satisfied, still they yearn after all
this with an honest hearty yearning, which must
put to shame the palled indifference, the only
affected enthusiasm of too many, whose opportunities
of cultivating this glorious faculty have
been so immeasurably greater than theirs. This
being so, and proverbs being, as we have seen,
the sayings that have found favour with the people,
their peculiar inheritance, we may be quite sure
that there will be poetry, imagination, passion, in
them. So much we might affirm beforehand;
our closer examination of them will confirm the
confidence which we have been bold to entertain.</p>

<p>Thus we may expect to find that they will contain
often bold imagery, striking comparisons; and
such they do. Let serve as an example our own:
<cite>Gray hairs are death’s blossoms</cite>;<a name="Anchor-90" id="Anchor-90"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a> or the Italian:
<cite>Time is an inaudible file</cite>;<a name="Anchor-91" id="Anchor-91"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a> or the Greek: <cite>Man a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>bubble</cite>;<a name="Anchor-92" id="Anchor-92"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a> which Jeremy Taylor has expanded into
such glorious poetry in the opening of the <cite>Holy
Dying</cite>; or that Turkish: <cite>Death is a black camel
which kneels at every man’s gate</cite>; to take up, that
is, the burden of a coffin there; or this Arabic
one, on the never satisfied eye of desire: <cite>Nothing
but a handful of dust will fill the eye of man</cite>; or
another from the same quarter, worthy of Mecca’s
prophet himself, and of the earnestness with which
he realized Gehenna, whatever else he may have
come short in: <cite>There are no fans in hell</cite>; or this
other, also from the East: <cite>Hold all skirts of thy
mantle extended, when heaven is raining gold</cite>;
improve, that is, to the uttermost the happier crises
of thy spiritual life; or this Indian, to the effect
that good should be returned for evil: <cite>The sandal
tree perfumes the axe that fells it</cite>; or this one,
current in the Middle Ages: <cite>Whose life lightens,
his words thunder</cite>;<a name="Anchor-93" id="Anchor-93"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a> or once more, this Chinese:
<cite>Towers are measured by their shadows, and great
men by their calumniators</cite>; however this last may
have somewhat of an artificial air as tried by our
standard of the proverb.</p>

<p>There may be poetry in a play upon words; and
such we shall hardly fail to acknowledge in that
beautiful Spanish proverb: <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">La verdad es siempre
verde</cite>, which I must leave in its original form; for
were I to translate it, <cite>The truth is always green</cite>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>its charm and chief beauty would be looked for in
vain. It finds its pendant and complement in
another, which I must also despair of adequately
rendering: <cite lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gloria vana florece, y no grana</cite>;
which would express this truth, namely, that vain
glory can shoot up into stalk and ear, but can
never attain to the full grain in the ear. Nor can
we, I think, refuse the title of poetry to this Eastern
proverb, in which the wish that a woman may
triumph over her enemies, clothes itself thus:
<cite>May her enemies stumble over her hair</cite>;&mdash;may
she flourish so, may her hair, the outward sign of
this prosperity, grow so rich and long, may it so
sweep the ground, that her detractors and persecutors
may be entangled by it and fall.</p>

<div class="tbpara">
<div class="sidenote">Witty proverbs.</div>
<p>And then, how exquisitely witty many proverbs
are. Thus, not to speak of one familiar to us all,
which is perhaps the queen of all proverbs: <cite>The
road to hell is paved with good intentions</cite>;<a name="Anchor-94" id="Anchor-94"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a> take
this Scotch one: <cite>A man may love his house well,
without riding on the ridge</cite>; it is enough for a
wise man to know what is precious to himself,
without making himself ridiculous by evermore
proclaiming it to the world; or this of our own:
<cite>When the devil is dead, he never wants a chief
mourner</cite>; in other words, there is no abuse so
enormous, no evil so flagrant, but that the interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
or passions of some will be so bound up in its continuance
that they will lament its extinction; or
this Italian: <cite>When rogues go in procession, the
devil holds the cross</cite>;<a name="Anchor-95" id="Anchor-95"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a> when evil men have it thus
far their own way, then worst is best, and in the
inverted hierarchy which is then set up, the foremost
in badness is foremost also in such honour as
is going. Or consider how happily the selfishness
and bye-ends which too often preside at men’s very
prayers are noted in this Portuguese: <cite>Cobblers
go to mass, and pray that cows may die</cite>;<a name="Anchor-96" id="Anchor-96"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a> that is,
that so leather may be cheap. Or, take another,
a German one, noting with slightest exaggeration
a measure of charity which is only too common:
<cite>He will swallow an egg, and give away the shells
in alms</cite>; or this from the Talmud, of which I will
leave the interpretation to yourselves: <cite>All kinds
of wood burn silently, except thorns, which crackle
and call out, We too are wood</cite>.</p>
</div>

<p>The wit of proverbs spares few or none. They
are, as may be supposed, especially intolerant of
fools. <em>We</em> say: <cite>Fools grow without watering</cite>;
no need therefore of adulation or flattery, to
quicken them to a ranker growth; for indeed
<cite>The more you stroke the cat’s tail, the more he
raises his back</cite>;<a name="Anchor-97" id="Anchor-97"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a>
and the Russians: <cite>Fools are not
planted or sowed; they grow of themselves</cite>; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the Spaniards: <cite>If folly were a pain, there would
be crying in every house</cite>;<a name="Anchor-98" id="Anchor-98"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a> having further an
exquisitely witty one on learned folly as the most
intolerable of all follies: <cite>A fool, unless he know
Latin, is never a great fool</cite>.<a name="Anchor-99" id="Anchor-99"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a> And here is excellently
unfolded to us the secret of the fool’s confidence:
<cite>Who knows nothing, doubts nothing</cite>.<a name="Anchor-100" id="Anchor-100"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a></p>

<p>The shafts of their pointed satire are directed
with an admirable impartiality against men of
every degree, so that none of us will be found to
have wholly escaped. To pass over those, and
they are exceedingly numerous, which are aimed
at members of the monastic orders,<a name="Anchor-101" id="Anchor-101"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a> I must fain
<span class="sidenote">Bohemian proverb.</span>
hope that this Bohemian one, pointing at the
clergy, is not true; for it certainly argues no very
forgiving temper on our parts in cases where we
have been, or fancy ourselves to have been,
wronged. It is as follows: <cite>If you have offended
a clerk, kill him; else you never will have peace
with him</cite>.<a name="Anchor-102" id="Anchor-102"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a>
And another proverb, worthy to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
its place among the best even of the Spanish,
charges the clergy with being the authors of the
chiefest spiritual mischiefs which have risen up in
the Church: <cite>By the vicar’s skirts the devil climbs
up into the belfry</cite>.<a name="Anchor-103" id="Anchor-103"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a> Nor do physicians appear in
the middle ages to have been in very high reputation
for piety; for a Latin medieval proverb boldly
proclaims: <cite>Where there are three physicians,
there are two atheists</cite>.<a name="Anchor-104" id="Anchor-104"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a> And as for lawyers, this
of the same period, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legista, nequista</cite>,<a name="Anchor-105" id="Anchor-105"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a> expresses
itself not with such brevity only, but with such
downright plainness of speech, that I shall excuse
myself from attempting to render it into English.
Nor do other sorts and conditions of men escape.
“The miller tolling with his golden thumb,” has
been often the object of malicious insinuations;
and of him the Germans have a proverb: <cite>What
is bolder than a miller’s neckcloth, which takes a
thief by the throat every morning?</cite><a name="Anchor-106" id="Anchor-106"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a> Evenhanded
justice might perhaps require that I should find
caps for other heads; and it is not that such are
wanting, nor yet out of fear lest any should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
offended, but only because I must needs hasten
onward, that I leave this part of my subject
without further development.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs about pride.</div>
<p>What a fine knowledge of the human heart will
they often display. I know not whether this
Persian saying on the subtleties of pride is a proverb
in the very strictest sense of the word, but it
is forcibly uttered: <cite>Thou shalt sooner detect an
ant moving in the dark night on the black earth,
than all the motions of pride in thine heart</cite>. And
on the wide reach of this sin the Italians say: <cite>If
pride were as art, how many graduates we should
have</cite>;<a name="Anchor-107" id="Anchor-107"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> and how excellent and searching is this
word of theirs on the infinitely various shapes
which this protean sin will assume: <cite>There are who
despise pride with a greater pride</cite>,<a name="Anchor-108" id="Anchor-108"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a> one which
might almost seem to have been founded on the
story of Diogenes, who, treading under his feet a
rich carpet of Plato’s, exclaimed, “Thus I trample
on the ostentation of Plato;” ‘With an ostentation
of thine own,’ was the other’s excellent retort;&mdash;even
as on another occasion he observed, with
admirable wit, that he saw the pride of the Cynic
peeping through the rents of his mantle: for indeed
pride can array itself quite as easily in rags
as in purple; can affect squalors as earnestly as
splendours; the lowest place and the last is of
itself no security at all for humility; and out of a
sense of this <em>we</em> very well have said: <cite>As proud go
behind as before</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes in their subtle observation of life,
they arrive at conclusions which we would very
willingly question or reject, but to which it is
impossible to refuse a certain amount of assent.
Thus it is with the very striking German proverb:
<cite>One foe is too many; and an hundred friends too
few</cite>.<a name="Anchor-109" id="Anchor-109"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a> There speaks out in this a sense of how
much more <em>active</em> a principle in this world will
hate be sometimes than love. The hundred friends
will <em>wish</em> you well; but the one foe will <em>do</em> you
ill. Their benevolence will be ordinarily passive;
his malevolence will be constantly active; it will
be <em>animosity</em>, or spiritedness in evil. The proverb
will have its use, if we are stirred up by it to prove
its assertion false, to show that, in very many cases
at least, there is no such blot as it would set on the
scutcheon of true friendship. In the same rank
of unwelcome proverbs I must range this Persian
one: <cite>Of four things every man has more than he
knows: of sins, of debts, of years, and of foes</cite>;
and this Spanish: <cite>One father can support ten
children; ten children cannot support one father</cite>;
which, in so far as it rests upon a certain ground
of truth, suggests a painful reflection in regard of
the less strength which there must be in the filial
than in the paternal affection, since to the one
those acts of self-sacrificing love are easy, which to
the other are hard, and often impossible. But yet,
seeing that it is the order of God’s providence in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
world that fathers should in all cases support children,
while it is the exception when children are
called to support parents, one can only admire
that wisdom which has made the instincts of
natural affection to run rather in the descending
than in the ascending line; a wisdom to which
this proverb, though with a certain exaggeration
of the facts, bears witness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French proverb.</div>
<p>How exquisitely delicate is the touch of this
French proverb: <cite>It is easy to go afoot, when one
leads one’s horse by the bridle</cite>.<a name="Anchor-110" id="Anchor-110"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a> How fine and
subtle an insight into the inner workings of the
human heart is here; how many cheap humilities
are here set at their true worth. It <em>is</em> easy to
stoop from state, when that state may be resumed
at will; easy for one to part with luxuries and
indulgences, which he only parts with exactly so
long as it may please himself. No reason indeed
is to be found in this comparative easiness for the
not ‘going afoot;’ on the contrary, it may be to
him a most profitable exercise; but every reason
for not esteeming the doing so too highly, nor
setting it on a level with the trudging upon foot
of him, who has no horse to fall back on at whatever
moment he may please.</p>

<p>There is, and always must be, some rough work
to be done in the world; work which, though
rough, is not therefore in the least ignoble; and
the schemes, so daintily conceived, of a luxurious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
society, which repose on a tacit assumption that
nobody shall have to do this work, are touched
with a fine irony in this Arabic proverb: <cite>If I am
master, and thou art master, who shall drive the
asses?</cite><a name="Anchor-111" id="Anchor-111"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a></p>

<p>Again, how clever is the satire of the following
Haytian proverb, which, however, I must introduce
with a little preliminary explanation. It was one
current among the slave population of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Domingo,
and with it they ridiculed the ambition and
pretension of the mulatto race immediately above
them. These, in imitation of the French planters,
must have their duels too&mdash;duels, however, which
had nothing earnest or serious about them, invariably
ending in a reconciliation and a feast, the
kids which furnished the latter being in fact the
only sufferers, their blood that which alone was
shed. All this the proverb uttered: <cite>Mulattoes
fight, kids die</cite>.<a name="Anchor-112" id="Anchor-112"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a></p>

<p>And proverbs, witty in themselves, often become
wittier still in their application, like gems that
acquire new brilliancy from their setting, or from
some novel light in which they are held. No writer
that I know of has an happier skill in thus adding
<span class="sidenote">Fuller’s use of proverbs.</span>
wit to the witty than Fuller, the Church historian.
Let me confirm this assertion by one or two
examples drawn from his writings. He is describing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the indignation, the outcries, the remonstrances,
which the thousandfold extortions, the
intolerable exactions of the Papal See gave birth
to in England during the reigns of such subservient
kings as our Third Henry; yet he will not have
his readers to suppose that the Popes fared a whit
the worse for all this outcry which was raised
against them; not so, for <cite>The fox thrives best when
he is most cursed</cite>;<a name="Anchor-113" id="Anchor-113"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a> the very loudness of the clamour
was itself rather an evidence how well they were
faring. Or again, he is telling of that Duke of
Buckingham, well known to us through Shakespeare’s
<cite>Richard the Third</cite>, who, having helped
the tyrant to a throne, afterwards took mortal displeasure
against him; this displeasure he sought
to hide, till a season arrived for showing it with
effect, in the deep of his heart, but in vain; for,
as Fuller observes, <cite>It is hard to halt before a
cripple</cite>; the arch-hypocrite Richard, he to whom
dissembling was as a second nature, saw through
and detected at once the shallow Buckingham’s
clumsier deceit. And the <cite>Church History</cite> abounds
with similar happy applications. Fuller, indeed,
possesses so much of the wit out of which proverbs
spring, that it is not seldom difficult to tell whether
he is adducing a proverb, or uttering some proverb-like
saying of his own. Thus, I cannot remember
ever to have met any of the following, which yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
sound like proverbs&mdash;the first on solitude as preferable
to ill fellowship: <cite>Better ride alone than
have a thief’s company</cite>;<a name="Anchor-114" id="Anchor-114"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a> the second against certain
who disparaged one whose excellencies they would
have found it very difficult to imitate: <cite>They who
complain that Grantham steeple stands awry, will
not set a straighter by it</cite>,<a name="Anchor-115" id="Anchor-115"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a> and in this he warns
against despising in any the tokens of honourable
toil: <cite>Mock not a cobbler for his black thumbs</cite>.<a name="Anchor-116" id="Anchor-116"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a></p>

<p>But the glory of proverbs, that, perhaps, which
strikes us most often and most forcibly in regard
of them, is their shrewd common sense, the sound
wisdom for the management of our own lives, and
of our intercourse with our fellows, which so many
of them contain. In truth, there is no region of
practical life which they do not occupy, for which
they do not supply some wise hints and counsels
and warnings. There is hardly a mistake which in
the course of our lives we have committed, but
some proverb, had we known and attended to its
lesson, might have saved us from it. “Adages,”
indeed, according to the more probable etymology
of that word, they are, <em>apt for action</em> and use.<a name="Anchor-117" id="Anchor-117"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wisdom of silence.</div>
<p>Thus, how many of these popular sayings and
what good ones there are on the wisdom of governing
the tongue,&mdash;I speak not now of those urging
the <em>duty</em>, though such are by no means wanting,&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the wisdom, prudence, and profit of knowing
how to keep silence as well as how to speak. The
Persian, perhaps, is familiar to many: <cite>Speech is
silvern, silence is golden</cite>; with which we may
compare the Italian: <cite>Who speaks, sows; who
keeps silence, reaps</cite>;<a name="Anchor-118" id="Anchor-118"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a> and on the <em>safety</em> that is in
silence, I know none happier than another from
the same quarter, and one most truly characteristic
of Italian caution: <cite>Silence was never written
down</cite>;<a name="Anchor-119" id="Anchor-119"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a> while, on the other hand, we are excellently
warned of the irrevocableness of the word which
has once gone from us in this Eastern proverb: <cite>Of
thine unspoken word thou art master; thy spoken
word is master of thee</cite>; even as the same is set
out elsewhere by many striking comparisons; it is
the arrow from the bow, the stone from the sling;
and, once launched, can as little be recalled as
these.<a name="Anchor-120" id="Anchor-120"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a>
Our own, <cite>He who says what he likes, shall
hear what he does not like</cite>, gives a further motive
for self-government in speech; while this Spanish
is in an higher strain: <cite>The evil which issues from
thy mouth falls into thy bosom</cite>.<a name="Anchor-121" id="Anchor-121"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a> Nor is it enough
to abstain ourselves from all such words; we must
not make ourselves partakers in those of others;
which it is only too easy to do; for, as the Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
have said very well: <cite>He who laughs at an impertinence,
makes himself its accomplice</cite>.</p>

<p>And then, in proverbs not a few what profitable
warnings have we against the fruits of evil companionship,
as in that homely one of our own:
<cite>He that lies down with dogs shall rise up with
fleas</cite>;<a name="Anchor-122" id="Anchor-122"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a> or, again, in the old Hebrew one: <cite>Two dry
sticks will set on fire one green</cite>; or, in another
from the East, which has to do with the same
theme, and plainly shows whither such companionship
will lead: <cite>He that takes the raven for a guide,
shall light upon carrion</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good sense in proverbs.</div>
<p>What warnings do many contain against unreasonable
expectations, against a looking for perfection
in a world of imperfection, and generally a
demanding of more from life than life can yield.
<em>We</em> note very well the folly of one addicted to this,
saying: <cite>He expects better bread than can be made
of wheat</cite>; and the Portuguese: <cite>He that will have
an horse without fault, let him go afoot</cite>; and the
French: <cite>Where the goat is tied, there she must
browse</cite>.<a name="Anchor-123" id="Anchor-123"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a> Again, what a good word of caution in
respect of the wisdom of considering oftentimes a
step which, being once taken, is taken for ever, lies
in the following Russian proverb: <cite>Measure thy
cloth ten times; thou canst cut it but once</cite>. And
in this Spanish the final issues of procrastination
are well set forth: <cite>By the street of “By-and-bye”
one arrives at the house of “Never.”</cite><a name="Anchor-124" id="Anchor-124"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a> In how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
pleasant a way discretion in avoiding all appearance
of evil is urged in the following Chinese: <cite>In a
field of melons tie not thy shoe; under a plum-tree
adjust not thy cap</cite>. And this Danish warns
us well against relying too much on other men’s
silence, since there is no rarer gift than the capacity
of keeping a secret: <cite>Tell nothing to thy friend
which thine enemy may not know</cite>. Here is a
word which we owe to Italy, and which, laid to
heart, might keep men out of law-suits, or, being in
them, from refusing to accept tolerable terms of
accommodation: <cite>The robes of lawyers are lined
with the obstinacy of suitors</cite>.<a name="Anchor-125" id="Anchor-125"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a> Other words of
wisdom and warning, for so I must esteem them,
are these; this, on the danger of being overset by
prosperity: <cite>Everything may be borne, except good
fortune</cite>;<a name="Anchor-126" id="Anchor-126"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a> with which may be compared our own:
<cite>Bear wealth, poverty will bear itself</cite>; and another
Italian which says: <cite>In prosperity no altars smoke</cite>.<a name="Anchor-127" id="Anchor-127"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a>
This is on the disgrace which will sooner or later
follow upon dressing ourselves out in intellectual
finery that does not belong to us: <cite>Who arrays
himself in other men’s garments, is stripped in
the middle of the street</cite>;<a name="Anchor-128" id="Anchor-128"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a> he is detected and laid
bare when and where detection is most shameful.</p>

<p>Of the same miscellaneous character, and derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
from quarters the most diverse, but all of
them of an excellent sense or shrewdness, are the
following. This is from Italy: <cite>Who sees not the
bottom, let him not pass the water</cite>.<a name="Anchor-129" id="Anchor-129"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a> This is current
among the free blacks of Hayti: <cite>Before fording
the river, do not curse Mrs. Alligator</cite>;<a name="Anchor-130" id="Anchor-130"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a> provoke
not wantonly those in whose power you presently
may be. This is Spanish: <cite>Call me not “olive,”
till you see me gathered</cite>;<a name="Anchor-131" id="Anchor-131"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 131.">[131]</a> being nearly parallel
to our own: <cite>Praise a fair day at night</cite>; and
this French: <cite>Take the first advice of a woman,
and not the second</cite>;<a name="Anchor-132" id="Anchor-132"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 132.">[132]</a> a proverb of much wisdom;
for in processes of reasoning, out of which the
second counsels would spring, women may and will
be, inferior to us; but in intuitions, in moral intuitions
above all, they surpass us far; they have
what <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montaigne</span> ascribes to them in a remarkable
word, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’esprit <em>primesautier</em></span>,” the leopard’s spring,
which takes its prey, if it be to take it at all, at
the first bound.</p>

<p>And I cannot but think that for as many as are
seeking diligently to improve their time and opportunities
of knowledge, with at the same time little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of either which they can call their own, a very
useful hint and warning against an error which lies
very near, is contained in the little Latin proverb:
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Compendia, dispendia</cite>. Nor indeed for them only,
but for all, and in numberless respects it often proves
true that a short cut may be a very long way home;
yet the proverb can never be applied better than to
those little catechisms of science, those skeleton
outlines of history, those epitomes of all useful information,
those thousand delusive short cuts to the
attainment of that knowledge, which can indeed
only be acquired by them that are content to travel
on the king’s highway, on the old, and as I must
still call it, the royal road of patience, perseverance,
and toil. Surely these <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">compendia</em>, so meagre and
so hungry, with little food for the intellect, with
less for the affections, we may style with fullest
right <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">dispendia</em>, wasteful as they generally prove
of whatever time and labour and money is bestowed
upon them; and every wise man will set his seal
to this word, as wisely as it is grandly spoken:
“All spacious minds, attended with the felicities
of means and leisure, will fly abridgements as bane.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs about books.</div>
<p>And being on the subject of books and the choice
of books, let me put before you a proverb, and in
this reading age a very serious one; it comes to us
from Italy, and it says: <cite>There is no worse robber
than a bad book</cite>.<a name="Anchor-133" id="Anchor-133"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 133.">[133]</a> Indeed, none worse, nor so bad;
other robbers may spoil us of our money; but this
robber of our “goods”&mdash;of our time at any rate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
even assuming the book to be only negatively bad;
but of how much more, of our principles, our faith,
our purity of heart, supposing its badness to be
positive, and not negative only. And one more on
books may fitly find place here: <cite>Dead men open
living men’s eyes</cite>; at least I take it to be such;
and to contain implicitly the praise of history, and
an announcement of the instruction which it will
yield us.<a name="Anchor-134" id="Anchor-134"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 134.">[134]</a></p>

<p>Here are one or two prudent words on education.
<cite>A child may have too much of its mother’s
blessing</cite>; yes, for that blessing may be no blessing,
but rather a curse, if it take the shape of foolish
and fond indulgence; and in the same strain is this
German: <cite>Better the child weep than the father</cite>.<a name="Anchor-135" id="Anchor-135"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135.">[135]</a>
And this, like many others, is found in so many
tongues, that it cannot be ascribed to one rather
than another: <cite>More springs in the garden than the
gardener ever sowed</cite>.<a name="Anchor-136" id="Anchor-136"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136.">[136]</a> It is a proverb for many,
but most of all for parents and teachers, that they
lap not themselves in a false dream of security, as
though nothing was at work or growing in the
minds of the young in their guardianship, but what
they themselves had sown there, as though there
was not another who might very well have sown
his tares beside and among any good seed of their
sowing. At the same time the proverb has also its
happier side. There may be, there often are, better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
things also in this garden than ever the earthly
gardener set there, seeds of the more immediate
sowing of God. In either of its aspects this
proverb is one deserving to be laid to heart.</p>

<p>Proverbs will sometimes outrun and implicitly
anticipate conclusions, which are only after long
struggles and efforts arrived at as the formal and
undoubted conviction of all thoughtful men. After
how long a conflict has that been established as a
maxim in political economy, which the brief Italian
<span class="sidenote">Gold’s worth is gold.</span>
proverb long ago announced: <cite>Gold’s worth is gold</cite>.<a name="Anchor-137" id="Anchor-137"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137.">[137]</a>
What millions upon millions of national wealth
have been as much lost as if they had been thrown
into the sea, from the inability of those who have
had the destinies of nations in their hands to grasp
this simple proposition, that everything which could
purchase money, or which money would fain purchase,
was as really wealth as the money itself.
What forcing of national industries into unnatural
channels has resulted from this, what mischievous
restrictions in the buying and selling of one people
with another. Nay, can the truth which this
proverb affirms be said even now to be accepted
without gainsaying&mdash;so long as the talk about the
balance of trade being in favour of or against a
nation, as the fear of draining a country of its gold,
still survive?</p>

<p>Here is a proverb of many tongues: <cite>One sword
keeps another in its scabbard</cite>;<a name="Anchor-138" id="Anchor-138"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<a href="#Footnote-138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138.">[138]</a>&mdash;surely a far wiser
and far manlier word than the puling yet mischievous
babble of our shallow Peace Societies,
which, while they fancy that they embody, and
they only embody, the true spirit of Christianity,
proclaim themselves in fact ignorant of all which it
teaches; for they dream of having peace the fruit,
while at the same time the root of bitterness out of
which have grown all the wars and fightings that
have ever been in the world, namely the lusts which
stir in men’s members, remain strong and vigorous
as ever. But no; it is not they that are the peacemakers:
in the face of an evil world, and of a world
determined to continue in its evil, <cite>He who bears
the sword</cite>, and though he fain would not, yet knows
how, if need be, to wield it, <cite>he bears peace</cite>.<a name="Anchor-139" id="Anchor-139"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139.">[139]</a></p>

<p>One of the most remarkable features of a good
proverb is the singular variety of applications which
it will admit, which indeed it challenges and invites.
Not lying on the surface of things, but going
deep down to their heart, it will be found capable
of being applied again and again, under circumstances
the most different; like the gift of which
Solomon spake, “whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth;”
or like a diamond cut and polished upon
many sides, which reflects and refracts the light
upon every one. There can be no greater mistake
than the attempt to tie it down and restrict it to a
single application, when indeed the very character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of it is that it is ever finding or making new ones
for itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scriptural proverb.</div>
<p>It is nothing strange that with words of Eternal
Wisdom this should be so, and in respect of them
my assertion cannot need a proof. I will, notwithstanding,
adduce as a first confirmation of it a
scriptural proverb, one which fell from the Lord’s
lips in his last prophecies about Jerusalem:
<cite>Wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be
gathered together</cite>; (<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> <abbr title="24">xxiv.</abbr> 28;) and which
probably He had taken up from Job. (<abbr title="39">xxxix.</abbr> 30.)
Who would venture to say that he had exhausted
the meaning of this wonderful saying? For is it
not properly inexhaustible? All history is a comment
on these words. Wherever there is a Church
or a people abandoned by the spirit of life, and so
a carcase, tainting the atmosphere of God’s moral
world, around it assemble the ministers and messengers
of Divine justice, “the eagles,” (or vultures
more strictly, for the true eagle does not feed on
aught but what itself has slain,) the scavengers of
God’s moral world; scenting out as by a mysterious
instinct the prey from afar, and charged to remove
presently the offence out of the way. This proverb,
for the saying has passed upon the lips of men, and
thus has become such, is being fulfilled evermore.
The wicked Canaanites were the carcase, when the
children of Israel entered into their land, the commissioned
eagles that should remove them out of
sight. At a later day the Jews were themselves
the carcase, and the Romans the eagles; and when
in the progress of decay, the Roman empire had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
quite lost the spirit of life, and those virtues of the
family and the nation which had deservedly made
it great, the northern tribes, the eagles now, came
down upon it, to tear it limb from limb, and make
room for a new creation that should grow up in its
stead. Again, the Persian empire was the carcase;
Alexander and his Macedonian hosts, the eagles
that by unerring instinct gathered round it to complete
its doom. The Greek Church in the seventh
century was too nearly a carcase to escape the
destiny of such, and the armies of Islam scented
their prey, and divided it among them. In modern
times Poland was, I fear, such a carcase; and this
one may affirm without in the least extenuating
their guilt who partitioned it; for it might have
been just for it to suffer, what yet it was most unrighteous
for others to inflict. Nay, where do you
not find an illustration of this proverb, from such
instances on the largest scale as these, down to
that of the silly and profligate heir, surrounded by
sharpers and black-legs, and preyed on by these?
Everywhere it is true that <cite>Wheresoever the carcase
is, there will the eagles be gathered together</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extremes meet.</div>
<p>Or, again, consider such a proverb as the short
but well-known one: <cite>Extremes meet</cite>. Short as it
is, it is yet a motto on which whole volumes might
be written, which is finding its illustration every
day,&mdash;in small and in great,&mdash;in things trivial and
in things most important,&mdash;in the histories of single
men, and in those of nations and of Churches.
Consider some of its every-day fulfilments,&mdash;old
age ending in second childhood,&mdash;cold performing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the effects of heat, and scorching as heat would
have done,&mdash;the extremities alike of joy and of
grief finding utterance in tears,&mdash;that which is
above all value declared to have no value at all,
to be “invaluable,”&mdash;the second singular “thou”
instead of the plural “you,” employed in so many
languages to inferiors and to God, never to equals;
just as servants and children are alike called by
the Christian name, but not those who stand in
the midway of intimacy between them. Or to
take some further illustrations from the moral
world, of extremes meeting; observe how often
those who begin their lives as spendthrifts end
them as misers; how often the flatterer and the
calumniator meet in the same person: out of a
sense of which the Italians say well: <cite>Who paints
me before, blackens me behind</cite>;<a name="Anchor-140" id="Anchor-140"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140.">[140]</a> observe how those
who yesterday would have sacrificed to Paul as a
god, will to-day stone him as a malefactor; (Acts
<abbr title="14">xiv.</abbr> 18, 19; cf. <abbr title="28">xxviii.</abbr> 4–6;) even as Roman emperors
would one day have blasphemous honours
paid to them by the populace, and the next their
bodies would be dragged by a hook through the
streets of the city, to be flung into the common
sewer. Or note again in what close alliance hardness
and softness, cruelty and self-indulgence (“lust
hard by hate”), are continually found; or in law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
how the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum jus</em>, where unredressed by equity,
becomes the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">summa injuria</em>, as in the case of
Shylock’s pound of flesh, which was indeed no
more than was in the bond. Or observe on a
greater scale, as lately in France, how a wild and
lawless democracy may be transformed by the
base trick of a conjuror into an atrocious military
tyranny.<a name="Anchor-141" id="Anchor-141"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 141.">[141]</a>
Or read thoughtfully the history of the
Church and of the sects, and you will not fail to
note what things apparently the most remote are
yet in the most fearful proximity with one another:
how often, for example, a false asceticism has issued
in frantic outbreaks of fleshly lusts, and those who
avowed themselves at one time ambitious to live
lives above men, have ended in living lives below
beasts. Again, take note of England at the
Restoration exchanging all in a moment the sour
strictness of the Puritans for a licence and debauchery
unknown to it before. Or, once more,
consider the exactly similar position in respect of
Scripture, taken up by the Romanists on the one
side, the Quakers and Familists on the other.
Seeming, and in much being, so remote from one
another, they yet have this fundamental in common,
that Scripture, insufficient in itself, needs a supplement
from without, those finding it in a Pope, and

<span class="stitle">THE MORALITY OF PROVERBS.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upcase">The</span> morality of proverbs is a subject which I
have not been able to leave wholly untouched
until now, for of necessity it has offered itself to us
continually, in one shape or another; yet hitherto
I have not regularly dealt with or considered it.
To it I propose to devote the present lecture. But
how, it may be asked at the outset, can any general
verdict be pronounced about them? In a family
like theirs, spread so widely over the face of the
earth, must there not be found worthy members
and unworthy, proverbs noble and base, holy and
profane, heavenly and earthly;&mdash;yea, heavenly,
earthly, and devilish? What common judgment
of praise or censure can be pronounced upon all of
these? Evidently none. The only question, therefore,
for our consideration must be, whether there
exists any such large and unquestionable preponderance
either of the better sort or of the worse, as
shall give us a right to pronounce a judgment on
the whole in their favour or against them, to affirm
of them that their preponderating influence and
weight is thrown into the balance of the good or of
the evil.</p>

<p>And here I am persuaded that no one can have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
devoted any serious attention to this aspect of the
subject, but will own, (and seeing how greatly
popular morals are affected by popular proverbs,
will own with thankfulness,) that, if not without
serious exceptions, yet still in the main they range
themselves under the banners of the right and of
the truth; he will allow that of so many as move
in an ethical sphere at all, very far more are
children of light and the day than of darkness
and night. Indeed, the comparative paucity of
unworthy proverbs is a very noticeable fact, and
one to the causes of which I shall have presently
to recur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coarse proverbs.</div>
<p>At the same time, when I affirm this, I find it
necessary to make certain explanations, to draw
certain distinctions. In the first place, I would
not, by what I have said, in the least deny that an
ample number of coarse proverbs are extant: it
needs but to turn over a page or two of Ray’s
<cite>Collection of English Proverbs</cite>, or of Howell’s, or
indeed of any collection in any tongue, which has
not been weeded carefully, to convince oneself of
the fact;&mdash;nor yet would I deny, that of these
many may, more or less, live upon the lips of men.
Having their birth, for the most part, in a period
of a nation’s literature and life, when men are
much more plain-spoken, and have far fewer
reticences than is afterwards the case, it is nothing
strange that some of them, employing words forbidden
now, but not forbidden then, should sound
coarse and indelicate enough in our ears: while
indeed there are others, whose offence and grossness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
these considerations, while they may mitigate,
are quite insufficient to excuse. But at the same
time, gross words and images, (I speak not of
wanton ones,) bad as they may be, are altogether
different from immoral maxims and rules of life.
And it is these immoral maxims, unrighteous,
selfish, or otherwise unworthy rules, of which I
would affirm the number to be, if not absolutely,
yet relatively small.</p>

<p>And then further, in estimating the morality of
proverbs, this also will claim in justice not to be
forgotten. In the same manner as coarse proverbs
are not necessarily immoral, so the application
which is made of a proverb by us may very often
be hardhearted and selfish, while yet the proverb
itself is very far from so being. This selfishness
and hardness lay not in it of primary intention,
but only by our abuse; and in the cases of several,
these two things, the proverb itself, and the ordinary
employment of it, will demand to be kept
carefully apart from one another. For instance:
<cite>He has made his bed, and now he must lie on it</cite>;&mdash;<cite>As
he has brewed, so he must drink</cite>;&mdash;<cite>As he
has sown, so must he reap</cite>;<a name="Anchor-144" id="Anchor-144"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 144.">[144]</a>&mdash;if these are
employed to justify us in refusing to save others,
so far as we may, from the consequences of their
own folly, or imprudence, or even guilt, why then
one can only say that they are very ill employed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and there are few of us with whom it would not
have gone hardly, had all those about us acted in
the spirit of these proverbs so misinterpreted; had
they refused to mitigate for us, so far as they could,
the consequences of our errors. But if the words
are taken in their true sense, as homely announcements
of that law of divine retaliations in the
world, according to which men shall eat of the
fruit of their own doings, and be filled with their
own ways, who shall gainsay them? What affirm
they more than every page of Scripture, every turn
of human life, is affirming too, namely, that the
everlasting order of God’s universe cannot be violated
with impunity, that there is a continual
returning upon men of what they have done, and
that in their history we may read their judgment?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charity begins at home.</div>
<p><cite>Charity begins at home</cite>, is the most obvious and
familiar of these proverbs, selfishly abused. It may
be, no doubt it often is, made the plea for a selfish
withholding of assistance from all but a few, whom
men may include in their “at home,” while sometimes
the proverb receives a narrower interpretation
still; and self, and self only, is accounted to be
“at home.” And yet, in truth, what were that
charity worth, which did <em>not</em> begin at home, which
did <em>not</em> preserve the divine order and proportion
and degree? It is not for nothing that we have
been grouped in families, neighbourhoods, and
nations; and he who will not recognise the divinely
appointed nearnesses to himself of some over others,
who thinks to be a cosmopolite without being a
patriot, a philanthropist without owning a distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
love for them that are peculiarly “his
own,” who would thus have a circumference without
a centre, deceives his own heart; and affirming all
men, to be equally dear to him, is indeed affirming
them to be equally indifferent. Home, the family,
this is as the hearth at which the affections which
are afterwards to go forth and warm in a larger
circle, are themselves to be kept lively and warm;
and the charity which did not exercise itself in
outcomings of kindness and love in the narrower,
would be little likely to seek a wider range for
itself. Wherever else it may <em>end</em>, and the larger
the sphere which it makes for itself the better, it
must yet <em>begin</em> at home.<a name="Anchor-145" id="Anchor-145"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145.">[145]</a></p>

<p>There are, again, proverbs which, from another
point of view, might seem of an ignoble cast, and
as calculated to lower the tone of morality among
those who received them; proposing as they do
secondary, and therefore unworthy, motives to
actions, which ought to be performed out of the
highest. I mean such as this: <cite>Honesty is the best
policy</cite>; wherein honesty is commended, not because
it is right, but because it is most prudent and
politic, and has the promise of this present world.
Now doubtless there are proverbs not a few which,
<span class="sidenote">Prudential morality.</span>
like this, move in the region of what has been by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Coleridge so well called “prudential morality;” and
did we accept them as containing the whole circle
of motives to honesty or other right conduct, nothing
could be worse, or more fitted to lower the moral
standard of our lives. He who resolves to be
honest because, and only because, it is <cite>the best
policy</cite>, will be little likely long to continue honest
at all. But the proverb does not pretend to usurp
the place of an ethical rule; it does not presume to
cast down the higher law which should determine
to honesty and uprightness, that it may put itself
in its place; it only declares that honesty, let alone
that it is the right thing, is also, even for this present
world, the wisest. Nor dare we, let me further
add, despise prudential morality, such as is embodied
in sayings like this. The motives which it suggests
are helps to a weak and tempted virtue, may prove
great assistances to it in some passing moment of
a violent temptation, however little they can be
regarded as able to make men <em>for a continuance</em>
even outwardly upright and just.</p>

<p>And once more, proverbs are not to be accounted
selfish, which announce selfishness; unless they do
it, either avowedly recommending it as a rule and
maxim of life, or, if not so, yet with an evident
complacency and satisfaction in the announcement
which they make, and in this more covert and
perhaps still more mischievous way, taking part
with the evil which they proclaim. There are a
great many proverbs, which a lover of his race
would be very thankful if there had been nothing
in the world to justify or to provoke; for the convictions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
they embody, the experiences on which
they rest must be regarded as very far from complimentary
to human nature: but seeing they
express that which is, however we might desire it
were not, it would be idle to wish them away, to
wish that this evil had not found its utterance.
Nay, it is much better that it should so have done;
for thus taking form and shape, and being brought
directly under notice, it may be better watched
against and avoided. Such proverbs, not selfish,
but rather detecting selfishness and laying it bare,
are the following; this Russian, on the only too
slight degree in which we are touched with other
men’s troubles: <cite>The burden is light on the
shoulders of another</cite>; with which the French may
be compared: <cite>One has always enough strength to
bear the misfortunes of one’s friends</cite>.<a name="Anchor-146" id="Anchor-146"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 146.">[146]</a> Such is
this Italian: <cite>Every one draws the water to his own
mill</cite>;<a name="Anchor-147" id="Anchor-147"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 147.">[147]</a> or as it appears in its eastern shape, which
brings up the desert-bivouack before one’s eyes:
<cite>Every one rakes the embers to his own cake</cite>. Such
this Latin, on the comparative wastefulness wherewith
that which is another’s is too often used:
<cite>Men cut broad thongs from other men’s leather</cite>;<a name="Anchor-148" id="Anchor-148"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 148.">[148]</a>
with many more of the same character, which it
would be only too easy to bring together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Selfish proverbs.</div>
<p>With all this, I would not of course in the least
deny that immoral proverbs, and only too many of
them, exist. For if they are, as we have recognised
them to be, the genuine transcript of what is stirring
in the hearts of men, then, since there is cowardice,
untruth, selfishness, unholiness, profaneness there,
how should these be wanting here? The world is
not so consummate an hypocrite as the entire
absence of all immoral proverbs would imply.
There will be merely selfish ones, as our own:
<cite>Every one for himself and God for us all</cite>; or as
this Dutch: <cite>Self’s the man</cite>;<a name="Anchor-149" id="Anchor-149"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149.">[149]</a> or more shamelessly
cynical still, as the French: <cite>Better a grape for me,
than two figs for thee</cite>;<a name="Anchor-150" id="Anchor-150"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150.">[150]</a> or again, such as proclaim
a doubt and disbelief in the existence of any high
moral integrity anywhere, as <cite>Every man has his
price</cite>; or assume that poor men can scarcely be
honest, as <cite>It is hard for an empty sack to stand
straight</cite>; or take it for granted that every man
would cheat every other if he could, as the French:
<cite>Count after your father</cite>;<a name="Anchor-151" id="Anchor-151"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151.">[151]</a> or, if they do not actually
“speak good of the covetous,” yet assume it possible
that a blessing can wait on that which a
wicked covetousness has heaped together, as the
Spanish: <cite>Blessed is the son, whose father went to
the devil</cite>; or find cloaks and apologies for sin, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the German: <cite>Once is never</cite>;<a name="Anchor-152" id="Anchor-152"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 152.">[152]</a> or such as would
imply that the evil of a sin lay not in its sinfulness,
but in the outward disgrace annexed to it, as the
Italian: <cite>A sin concealed is half forgiven</cite>.<a name="Anchor-153" id="Anchor-153"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 153.">[153]</a> Or
again there will be proverbs dastardly and base, as
the Spanish maxim of caution, which advises to
<cite>Draw the snake from its hole by another man’s
hand</cite>; to put, that is, another, and it may be for
your own profit, to the peril from which you shrink
yourself;&mdash;or more dastardly still, “scoundrel
maxims,” an old English poet has called them; as
for instance, that one which is acted on only too
often: <cite>One must howl with the wolves</cite>;<a name="Anchor-154" id="Anchor-154"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 154.">[154]</a> in other
words, when a general cry is raised against any, it
is safest to join it, lest one be supposed to sympathise
with its object; to howl <em>with</em> the wolves, if
one would not be hunted <em>by</em> them. In the whole
circle of proverbs I know no baser, nor more
dastardly than this. And yet who will say that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
has never traced in himself the cowardly temptation
to obey it? Besides these there will be, of
which I shall spare you any examples, proverbs
wanton and impure, and not merely proverbs thus
earthly and sensual, but devilish; such as some of
those Italian on revenge which I quoted in my
third lecture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Immoral proverbs rare.</div>
<p>But for all this these immoral proverbs, rank
weeds among the wholesome corn, are comparatively
rare. In the minority with all people, they
are immeasurably in the minority with most. The
fact is not a little worthy of our note. Surely
there lies in it a solemn testimony, that however
men may and do in their conduct continually
violate the rule of right, yet these violations are
ever felt to be such, are inwardly confessed not to
be the law of man’s life, but the transgressions of
the law; and thus, stricken as with a secret shame,
and paying an unconscious homage to the majesty
of goodness, they do not presume to raise themselves
into maxims, nor, for all the frequency with
which they may be repeated, pretend to claim
recognition as abiding standards of action.</p>

<div class="tbpara">
<p>As the sphere in which the proverb moves is no
imaginary world, but that actual and often very
homely world which is round us and about us; as
it does not float in the clouds, but sets its feet
firmly on this common earth of ours from which
itself once grew, being occupied with present needs
and every-day cares, it is only natural that the
proverbs having reference to money should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
numerous; and in the main it would be well if the
practice of the world rose to the height of its convictions
as expressed in these. Frugality is connected
with so many virtues&mdash;at least, its contrary
makes so many impossible&mdash;that the numerous
proverbial maxims inculcating this, than which
none perhaps are more frequent on the lips of
men, must be regarded as belonging to the better
order;<a name="Anchor-155" id="Anchor-155"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 155.">[155]</a> especially when taken with the check of
others, which forbid this frugality from degenerating
into a sordid and dishonourable parsimony; such,
I mean, as our own: <cite>The groat is ill saved which
shames its master</cite>. In how many the conviction
speaks out that the hastily-gotten will hardly be
the honestly-gotten, that “he who makes haste to
be rich shall not be innocent,” as when the Spaniards
say: <cite>He who will be rich in a year, at the half-year
they hang him</cite>;<a name="Anchor-156" id="Anchor-156"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 156.">[156]</a> in how many others, the confidence
that the ill-won will also be the ill-spent,<a name="Anchor-157" id="Anchor-157"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 157.">[157]</a>
that he who shuts up unlawful gain in his storehouses,
is shutting up a fire that will one day
destroy them. Very solemn and weighty in this
sense is the German proverb: <cite>The unrighteous
penny corrupts the righteous pound</cite>;<a name="Anchor-158" id="Anchor-158"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 158.">[158]</a> and the
Spanish, too, is striking: <cite>That which is another’s
always yearns for its lord</cite>;<a name="Anchor-159" id="Anchor-159"></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<a href="#Footnote-159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 159.">[159]</a> it yearns, that is, to
be gone and get to its true owner. In how many
the conviction is expressed that this mammon,
which more than anything else men are tempted
to think God does not concern Himself about, is
yet given and taken away by Him according to the
laws of his righteousness; given sometimes to his
enemies and for their greater punishment, that
under its fatal influence they may grow worse and
worse, for <cite>The more the carle riches, he wretches</cite>;
but oftener withdrawn, because no due acknowledgment
of Him was made in its use; as when
the German proverb declares: <cite>Charity gives itself
rich; covetousness hoards itself poor</cite>;<a name="Anchor-160" id="Anchor-160"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 160.">[160]</a> and the
Danish: <cite>Give alms, that thy children may not ask
them</cite>;
<span class="sidenote">Alms the salt of riches.</span>
and the Rabbis, with a yet deeper significance:
<cite>Alms are the salt of riches</cite>; the true antiseptic,
which as such shall prevent them from themselves
corrupting, and from corrupting those that
have them; which shall hinder them from developing
a germ of corruption, such as shall in the end
involve in one destruction them and their owners.<a name="Anchor-161" id="Anchor-161"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 161.">[161]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>At the same time, as it is the very character of
proverbs to look at matters all round, there are
others to remind us that even this very giving
itself shall be with forethought and discretion;
with selection of right objects, and in right proportion
to each. Teaching this, the Greeks said, <cite>Sow
with the hand, and not with the whole sack</cite>;<a name="Anchor-162" id="Anchor-162"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 162.">[162]</a> for
as it fares with the seed corn, which if it shall
prosper, must be providently dispersed with the
hand, not prodigally shaken from the sack’s mouth,
so is it with benefits, which shall do good either to
those who impart, or to those who receive them.
Thus again, there is a Danish which says, <cite>So give
to-day, that thou shalt be able to give to-morrow</cite>;
and another: <cite>So give to one, that thou shalt have
to give to another</cite>.<a name="Anchor-163" id="Anchor-163"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 163.">[163]</a> And as closing this series, as
teaching us in a homely but striking manner, with
an image Dantesque in its vigor, that a man shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
carry nothing away with him when he dieth, take
this Italian, <cite>Our last robe</cite>, that is our winding
sheet, <cite>is made without pockets</cite>.<a name="Anchor-164" id="Anchor-164"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 164.">[164]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Manly proverbs.</div>
<p>Let me further invite you to observe and to
admire the prevailing tone of manliness which
pervades the great body of the proverbs of all
nations: let me urge you to take note how very
few there are which would fain persuade you that
“luck is all,” or that your fortunes are in any
other hands, under God, than your own. This our
own proverb, <cite>Win purple and wear purple</cite>, proclaims.
There are some, but they are exceptions,
to which the gambler, the idler, the so-called
“waiter upon Providence,” can appeal. For the
most part, however, they courageously accept the
law of labour, <cite>No pains, no gains</cite>,&mdash;<cite>No sweat,
no sweet</cite>,&mdash;<cite>No mill, no meal</cite>,<a name="Anchor-165" id="Anchor-165"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 165.">[165]</a> as the appointed
law and condition of man’s life. <cite>Where wilt thou
go, ox, that thou wilt not have to plough?</cite><a name="Anchor-166" id="Anchor-166"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 166.">[166]</a> is the
Catalan remonstrance addressed to one, who imagines
by any outward change of circumstances to
evade the inevitable task and toil of existence.
And this is Turkish: <cite>It is not with saying Honey,
Honey, that sweetness will come into the mouth</cite>;
and to many languages another with its striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
image, <cite>Sloth, the key of poverty</cite>,<a name="Anchor-167" id="Anchor-167"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 167.">[167]</a> belongs: while,
on the other hand, there are in almost all tongues
such proverbs as the following: <cite>God helps them
that help themselves</cite>;<a name="Anchor-168" id="Anchor-168"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 168.">[168]</a> or as it appears with a
slight variation in the Basque: <cite>God is a good
worker, but He loves to be helped</cite>. And these
proverbs, let me observe by the way, were not
strange, in their import at least, to the founder of
that religion which is usually supposed to inculcate
a blind and indolent fatalism&mdash;however some who
call themselves by his name may have forgotten
the lesson which they convey. Certainly they
were not strange to Mahomet himself; if the following
excellently-spoken word has been rightly
ascribed to him. One evening, we are told, after
a weary march through the desert, he was camping
with his followers, and overheard one of them saying,
“I will loose my camel, and commit it to
God;” on which Mahomet took him up: “Friend,
<em>tie</em> thy camel, and commit it to God;”<a name="Anchor-169" id="Anchor-169"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 169.">[169]</a> do, that is,
whatever is thine to do, and then leave the issue
in higher hands; but till thou hast done this, till
thou hast thus helped thyself, thou hast no right
to look to Heaven to help thee.</p>

<p>How excellently this unites genuine modesty and
manly self-assertion: <cite>Sit in your own place, and
no man can make you rise</cite>; and how good is this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Spanish, on the real dignity which there often is in
doing things for ourselves, rather than in standing
by and suffering others to do them for us: <cite>Who
has a mouth, let him not say to another, Blow</cite>.<a name="Anchor-170" id="Anchor-170"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 170.">[170]</a>
And as a part of this which I have called the
manliness of proverbs, let me especially note the
noble utterances which so many contain, summoning
to a brave encountering of adverse fortune, to
perseverance under disappointment and defeat and
a long-continued inclemency of fate; breathing as
they do, a noble confidence that for the brave and
bold the world will not always be adverse. <cite>Where one
door shuts another opens</cite>;<a name="Anchor-171" id="Anchor-171"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 171.">[171]</a> this belongs to too
many nations to allow of our ascribing it especially
to any one. And this Latin: <cite>The sun of all days
has not yet gone down</cite>,<a name="Anchor-172" id="Anchor-172"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 172.">[172]</a> however, in its primary
application intended for those who are at the top
of Fortune’s wheel, to warn them that they be not
high-minded, for there is yet time for many a revolution
in that wheel, is equally good for those at
the bottom, and as it contains warning for those, so
strength and encouragement for these; for, as the
Italians say: <cite>The world is his who has patience</cite>.<a name="Anchor-173" id="Anchor-173"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 173.">[173]</a>
And then, to pass over some of our own, so familiar
that they need not be adduced, how manful a lesson
is contained in <span class="sidenote">Persian proverb.</span>this Persian proverb: <cite>A stone that
is fit for the wall, is not left in the way</cite>. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a saying made for them who appear for a while to
be overlooked, neglected, passed by; who perceive
in themselves capacities, which as yet no one
else has recognised or cared to turn to account.
Only <em>be fit for the wall</em>; square, polish, prepare
thyself for it; do not limit thyself to the bare
acquisition of such knowledge as is absolutely necessary
for thy present position; but rather learn
languages, acquire useful information, stretch thyself
out on this side and on that, cherishing and
making much of whatever aptitudes thou findest in
thyself; and it is certain thy turn will come. Thou
wilt not be <em>left in the way</em>; sooner or later the
builders will be glad of thee; the wall will need
thee to fill up a place in it, quite as much as thou
needest a place to occupy in the wall. For the
amount of real capacity in this world is so small,
that places want persons to fill them quite as really
as persons want to fill places; although it must be
allowed, they are not always as much aware of
their want.</p>

<p>And this proverb, Italian and Spanish, <cite>If I have
lost the ring, yet the fingers are still here</cite>,<a name="Anchor-174" id="Anchor-174"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 174.">[174]</a> is
another of these brave utterances of which I have
been speaking. In it is asserted the comparative
indifference of that loss which reaches but to
things external to us, so long us we ourselves remain,
and are true to ourselves. <em>The fingers</em> are
far more than <em>the ring</em>: if indeed those had gone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
then <em>the man</em> would have been maimed; but
another ring may come for that which has disappeared,
or even with none the fingers will be fingers
still. And as at once a contrast and complement to
this, take another, current among the free blacks
of Hayti, and expressing well the little profit which
there will be to a man in pieces of mere good luck,
which are no true outgrowths of anything which is
in him; the manner in which, having no root in
himself out of which they grew, they will, as they
came to him by hazard, go from him by the same:
<cite>The knife which thou hast found in the highway,
thou wilt lose in the highway</cite>.<a name="Anchor-175" id="Anchor-175"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 175.">[175]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Abuse of proverbs.</div>
<p>But these numerous proverbs, urging self-reliance,
bidding us first to aid ourselves, if we would have
Heaven to aid us, must not be dismissed without a
word or two at parting. Prizing them, as we well
may, and the lessons which they contain, at the
highest, yet it will be profitable for us at the same
time always to remember that to such there lies
very near such a mischievous perversion as this:
“Aid thyself, and thou wilt need no other aid;”
even as they have been sometimes, no doubt, understood
in this sense. As, then, the pendant and
counter-weight to them all, not as unsaying what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
they have said, but as fulfilling the other hemisphere
in the complete orb of truth, let me remind
you of such also as the following, often quoted or
alluded to by Greek and Latin authors: <cite>The net
of the sleeping (fisherman) takes</cite>;<a name="Anchor-176" id="Anchor-176"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 176.">[176]</a>&mdash;a proverb the
more interesting, that we have in the words of the
Psalmist, (<abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> <abbr title="127">cxxvii.</abbr> 2,) when accurately translated,
a beautiful and perfect parallel: “He giveth his
beloved” (not “sleep,” as in our version, but) “in
sleep;” God’s gifts gliding into his bosom, he
knowing not how, and as little expecting as having
laboured for them. Of how many of the best gifts
of every man’s life will he not thankfully acknowledge
this to have been true; or, if he refuse to
allow it, and will acknowledge no <em>eudæmonia</em>, no
‘favourable providence’ in his prosperities, but will
see them all as of work, how little he deserves,
how little likely he is, to retain them to the end.
Let us hold fast, then, this proverb as the most
needful complement of those.</p>

<div class="tbpara">
<p>I feel that I should be wanting to hearers such
as those who are assembled here, that I should fail
in that purpose which has been, more or less, present
to me even in dealing with the lighter portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of my subject, if I did not earnestly remind you of
the many of these sayings that there are, which,
while they have their lesson for all, yet seem more
directly addressed to those standing, as not a few of
us here, at the threshold of the more serious and
earnest portion of their lives. <span class="sidenote">Proverbs for young men.</span>
Lecturing to a <cite>Young
Men’s Society</cite>, I shall not unfitly press these upon
your notice. Take this Italian one, for instance:
<cite>When you grind your corn, give not the flour to
the devil, and the bran to God</cite>;&mdash;in the distribution,
that is, of your lives, apportion not your best years,
your strength and your vigour to the service of sin
and of the world, and only the refuse and rejected
to your Maker, the wine to others, and the lees
only to Him. Not so; for there is another ancient
proverb,<a name="Anchor-177" id="Anchor-177"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 177.">[177]</a> which we have made very well our own,
and which in English runs thus: <cite>It is too late to
spare, when all is spent</cite>. The words have obviously
a primary application to the goods of this present
life; it is ill saving here, when nothing or next to
nothing is left to save. But they are applied well
by a heathen moralist, (and the application lies very
near,) to those who begin to husband precious time,
and to live for life’s true ends, when life is nearly
gone, is now at its dregs; for, as he well urges, it
is not the least only which remains at the bottom,
but the worst.<a name="Anchor-178" id="Anchor-178"></a>

respect of each of our days, in which the earlier
hours given to toil will yield larger and more genial
returns than the later, is true in a yet higher sense,
of that great life-day, whereof all the lesser days of
our life make up the moments, is true in respect
of moral no less than mental acquisition. The
<em>evening</em> hours have often only <em>silver</em> in their mouths
at the best. Nor is this Arabic proverb, as it
appears to me, other than a very solemn one, being
far deeper than at first sight it might seem: <cite>Every
day in thy life is a leaf in thy history</cite>; a leaf which
shall once be turned back to again, that it may be
seen what was written there; and that whatever
<em>was</em> written may be read out in the hearing of all.</p>
</div>

<p>And among the proverbs having to do with a
prudent ordering of our lives from the very first,
this Spanish seems well worthy to be adduced:
<cite>That which the fool does in the end, the wise man
does at the beginning</cite>;<a name="Anchor-180" id="Anchor-180"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 180.">[180]</a> the wise with a good grace
what the fool with an ill; the one to much profit
what the other to little or to none. A word worth
laying to heart; for, indeed, that purchase of the
Sibylline books by the Roman king, what a significant
symbol it is of that which at one time or
another, or, it may be, at many times, is finding
place in almost every man’s life;&mdash;the same thing
to be done in the end, the same price to be paid at
the last, with only the difference, that much of the
advantage, as well as all the grace, of an earlier
compliance has past away. The nine precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
volumes have shrunk to six, and these dwindled to
three, while yet the like price is demanded for the
few as for the many; for the remnant now as
would once have made all our own.</p>

<p>I have already in a former lecture adduced a
proverb which warns against a bad book as the
worst of all robbers. In respect too of books
which are not bad, nay, of which the main staple
is good, but in which there is yet an admixture of
evil, as is the case with so many that have come
down to us from that old world not as yet partaker
of Christ, there is a proverb, which may very profitably
accompany us in our study of all these:
<cite>Where the bee sucks honey, the spider sucks poison</cite>.
<span class="sidenote">Study of the Classics.</span>
Very profitably may this word be kept in mind by
such as at any time are making themselves familiar
with the classical literature of antiquity, the great
writers of heathen Greece and Rome. How much
of noble, how much of elevating do they contain:
what love of country, what zeal for wisdom, may
be quickened in us by the study of them; yea,
even to us Christians what intellectual, what large
moral gains will they yield. Let the student be
as the bee looking for honey, and from the fields
and gardens of classical literature he may store it
abundantly in his hive. And yet from this same
body of literature what poison is it possible to
draw; what loss, through familiarity with evil, of
all vigorous abhorrence of it, till even the foulest
enormities shall come to be regarded with a speculative
curiosity rather than with an earnest hatred,&mdash;yea,
what lasting defilements of the imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and the heart may be contracted hence, till
nothing shall be pure, the very mind and conscience
being defiled. Let there come one whose
sympathies and affinities are with the poison and
not with the honey, and in these fields it will not
be impossible for him to find deadly flowers and
weeds from which he may suck poison enough.</p>

<p>With a few remarks on two proverbs more I
will bring this lecture to an end. Here is one with
an insight at once subtle and profound into the
heart of man: <cite>Ill doers are ill deemers</cite>; and
instead of any commentary on this of my own let
me quote some words which were not intended to
be a commentary upon it at all, and which furnish
notwithstanding a better than any which I could
hope to give. They are words of a great English
divine of the 17th century, who is accounting for
the offence which the Pharisee took at the Lord’s
acceptance of the affectionate homage and costly
offering of the woman that was a sinner: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>“Which
familiar and affectionate officiousness, and sumptuous
cost, together with that sinister fame that
woman was noted with, could not but give much
scandal to the Pharisees there present. For that
dispensation of the law under which they lived
making nothing perfect, but only curbing the outward
actions of men; it might very well be that
they, being conscious to themselves of no better
motions within than of either bitterness or lust,
how fair soever they carried without, could not
deem Christ’s acceptance of so familiar and affectionate
a service from a woman of that fame to
proceed from anything better than some loose and
vain principle ... for by how much every one is
himself obnoxious to temptation, by so much more
suspicious he is that others transgress, when there
is anything that may tempt out the corruptions of
a man.”<a name="Anchor-181" id="Anchor-181"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 181.">[181]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Chinese proverb.</div>
<p>And in this Chinese proverb which follows,
<cite>Better a diamond with a flaw, than a pebble
without one</cite>, there is, to my mind, the assertion of
a great Christian truth, and of one which reaches
deep down to the very foundations of Christian
morality, the more valuable as coming to us from
a people beyond the range and reach of the
influences of direct Revelation. We may not be
all aware of the many and malignant assaults
which were made on the Christian faith, and on
the morality of the Bible, through the character of
David, by the blind and self-righteous Deists of a
century or more ago. Taking the Scripture testimony
about him, that he was the man after God’s
heart, and putting beside this the record of those
great sins which he committed, they sought to set
these great, yet still isolated, offences in the most
hateful light; and thus to bring at once him, and
the Book which praised him, to a common shame.
But all this while, the question of <em>the man</em>, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
he was, and what the moral sum total of his life,
to which alone the Scripture testimony bore witness,
and to which alone it was pledged, this was a
question with which they concerned themselves not
at all; while yet it was a far more important
question than what any of his single acts may have
been; and it was this which, in the estimate of his
character, was really at issue. To this question <em>we</em>
answer, <cite>a diamond</cite>, which, if a diamond <cite>with a
flaw</cite>, as are all but the one “entire and perfect
chrysolite,” would yet outvalue a mountain of
<cite>pebbles without one</cite>, such as they were; even
assuming the pebbles to <em>be</em> without; and not
merely to <em>seem</em> so, because their flaw was an all-pervading
one, and only not so quickly detected,
inasmuch as the contrast was wanting of any clearer
material which should at once reveal its presence.</p>

There is one remarkable Latin proverb on the moral
cowardliness which it is the character of riches to generate,
saying more briefly the same which Wordsworth said
when he proclaimed&mdash;</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse12">“that riches are akin</div>
<div class="verse">To fear, to change, to cowardice, and death;”</div>

</div>

<p>it is this: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Timidus Plutus</span>: and has sometimes suggested
to me the question whether he might not have had it in

of the invasion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“These times touch monied worldlings with dismay;”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>not that his genius needed any such solicitation from
without; for the poem is only the natural outgrowth of
that spirit and temper in which the whole series of noble
and ennobling poems, the <cite>Sonnets to Liberty</cite>, is composed,
and in perfect harmony with the rest; yet is it, notwithstanding,
in a very wonderful way shut up in the two
words of the ancient proverb.</p></li>

<span class="stitle">THE THEOLOGY OF PROVERBS.</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upcase">I sought</span>, as best I could, in my last lecture
to furnish you with some helps for estimating
the ethical worth of proverbs. Their theology alone
remains; the aspects, that is, under which they
contemplate, not now any more man’s relations
with his fellow-man, but those on which in the end
all other must depend, his relations with God.
Between the subject matter, indeed, of that lecture
and of this I have found it nearly impossible to
draw any very accurate line of distinction. Much
which was there might nearly as fitly have been
here; some which I have reserved for this might
already have found its place there. It is this, however,
which I propose more directly to consider,
namely, what proverbs have to say concerning the
moral government of the world, and, more important
still, concerning its Governor? How does
all this present itself to the popular mind and
conscience, as attested by these? What, in short,
is their theology? for such, good or bad, it is
evident that abundantly they have.</p>

<p>Here, as everywhere else, their testimony is a
mingled one. The darkness, the error, the confusion
of man’s heart, out of which he oftentimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
sees distortedly, and sometimes sees not at all, have
all embodied themselves in his word. Yet still, as
it is the very nature of the false, in its separate
manifestations, to resolve into nothingness, though
only to be succeeded by new births in a like kind,
while the true abides and continues, it has thus
come to pass that we have generally in those utterances
on which the stamp of permanence has been
set, the nobler voices, the truer faith of humanity,
in respect of its own destinies and of Him by
whom those destinies are ordered.</p>

<p>I would not hesitate to say that the great glory
of proverbs in this their highest aspect, and that
which makes many of them so full of blessing to
those who cordially accept them, is the conviction
of which they are full, that, despite all appearances
to the contrary, this world is God’s world, and not
the world of the devil, or of those wicked men who
may be prospering for an hour; there is nothing in
them so precious as their faith that in the long run
it will approve itself to be such: which being so,
that it must be well in the end with the doer of
the right, the speaker of the truth; no blind
“whirligig of time,” but the hand of the living
God, in due time “bringing round its revenges.”
It is impossible to estimate too highly their bold
and clear proclamation of this conviction; for it is,
after all, the belief of this or the denial of this, on
which everything in the life of each one of us turns.
On this depends whether we shall separate ourselves
from the world’s falsehood and evil, and do vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
battle against them; or acquiesce in, and be ourselves
absorbed by, them.</p>

<p>Listen to proverbs such as these; surely they are
penetrated with the assurance that one who, Himself
being The Truth, will make truth in small and
in great to triumph at the last, is ruling over all:
<span class="sidenote">A lie has no legs.</span>
and first, hear a proverb of our own: <cite>A lie has no
legs</cite>; it is one true alike in its humblest application
and its highest; be the lie the miserable petty
falsehood which disturbs a family or a neighbourhood
for a day; or one of the larger frauds, the
falsehoods not in word only but in act, to which
a longer date and a far larger sphere are assigned,
which for a time seem to fill the world, and to
carry everything in triumph before them. Still
the lie, in that it is a lie, always carries within
itself the germs of its own dissolution. It is sure
to destroy itself at last. Its priests may prop it
up from without, may set it on its feet again, after
it has once fallen before the presence of the truth,
yet this all will be labour in vain; it will only be,
like Dagon, again to fall, and more shamefully and
more irretrievably than before.<a name="Anchor-182" id="Anchor-182"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 182.">[182]</a> On the other
hand, the vivacity of the truth, as contrasted with
this short-lived character of the lie, is well expressed
in a Swiss proverb: <cite>It takes a good many shovelfuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of earth to bury the truth</cite>. For, bury it as deep as
men may, it will have a resurrection notwithstanding.
They may roll a great stone, and seal the
sepulchre in which it is laid, and set a watch upon
it, yet still, like its Lord, it comes forth again at
its appointed hour. It cannot die, being of an
immortal race; for, as the Spanish proverb nobly
declares, <cite>The truth is daughter of God</cite>.<a name="Anchor-183" id="Anchor-183"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 183.">[183]</a></p>

<p>Again, consider this proverb: <cite>Tell the truth,
and shame the devil</cite>. It is one which will well
repay a few thoughtful moments bestowed on it,
and the more so, because, even while we instinctively
feel its truth, the deep moral basis on which it
rests may yet not reveal itself to us at once. Nay,
the saying may seem to contradict the actual experience
of things; for how often telling the truth&mdash;confessing,
that is, some great fault, taking home
to ourselves, it may be, some grievous sin&mdash;would
appear anything rather than shaming the devil;
shaming indeed ourselves, but rather bringing glory
to him, whose glory, such as it is, is in the sin
and shame of men. And yet the word is true,
and deeply true, notwithstanding. The element of
lies is that in which alone he who is “the father
of them” lives and thrives. So long then as a
wrong-doer presents to himself, or seeks to present
to others, the actual facts of his conduct different
from what they really are, conceals, palliates,
denies them,&mdash;so long, in regard of that man,
Satan’s kingdom stands. But so soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
things concerning himself are seen and owned by
a man as they indeed exist in God’s sight, as they
are when weighed in the balances of the eternal
righteousness; when once a man has brought himself
to tell the truth to himself, and, where need
requires, to others also, then having done, and in
so far as he has done this, he has abandoned the
devil’s standard, he belongs to the kingdom of the
truth; and as belonging to it he may rebuke, and
does rebuke and put to shame, all makers and
lovers of a lie, even to the very prince of them all.
“Give glory to God,” was what Joshua said to
Achan, when he would lead him to confess his
guilt. This is but the other and fairer side of the
tapestry; this is but <em>shame the devil</em>, on its more
blessed side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vox populi, vox Dei.</div>
<p>Once more;&mdash;the Latin proverb, <cite>The voice of
the people, the voice of God</cite>,<a name="Anchor-184" id="Anchor-184"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 184.">[184]</a> is one which it is
well worth our while to understand. If it were
affirmed in this that every outcry of the multitude,
supposing only it be loud enough and wide enough,
ought to be accepted as the voice of God speaking
through them, no proposition more foolish or more
impious could well be imagined. But <cite>the voice of
the people</cite> is something very different from this.
The proverb rests on the assumption that the
foundations of man’s being are laid in the truth;
from which it will follow, that no conviction which
is really a conviction of the universal humanity,
but reposes on a true ground; no faith, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
indeed the faith of mankind, but has a reality
corresponding to it: for, as Jeremy Taylor has
said: “It is not a vain noise, when many nations
join their voices in the attestation or detestation of
an action;” and Hooker: “The general and perpetual
voice of men is as the sentence of God Himself.
For that which all men have at all times
learned, nature herself must needs have taught;
and God being the author of nature, her voice is
but his instrument.” (<cite><abbr title= "The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity">Eccles. Pol.</abbr></cite>, b. <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> <abbr title="section">§</abbr> 8.) The
task and difficulty, of course, must ever be to discover
what this faith and what these convictions
are; and this can only be done by an induction
from a sufficient number of facts, and in sufficiently
different times, to enable us to feel confident that
we have indeed seized that which is the constant
quantity of truth in them all, and separated this
from the inconstant one of falsehood and error,
evermore offering itself in its room; that we have
not taken some momentary cry, wrung out by
interest, by passion, or by pain, for <cite>the voice of
God</cite>; but claimed this august title only for that
true voice of humanity, which, unless everything
be false, we have a right to assume an echo of the
voice of God.</p>

<p>Thus, to take an example, the natural horror
everywhere felt in regard of marriages contracted
between those very near in blood, has been always
and with right appealed to as a potent argument
against such unions. The induction is so large,
that is, the nations who have agreed in entertaining
this horror are so many, oftentimes nations disagreeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
in almost everything besides; the times
during which this instinctive revolt against such
unions has been felt, extend through such long
ages; that the few exceptions, even where they are
of civilized nations, as of the Egyptians who
married their sisters, or of the Persians, among
whom marriages more dreadful still were permitted,
cannot be allowed any weight; and of course still
less the exception of any savage tribe, in which all
that constitutes the human in humanity has now
disappeared. These exceptions can only be regarded
as violations of the divine order of man’s
life; not as evidences that we have falsely imagined
an order where there was none. Here is
a true <cite>voice of the people</cite>; and on the grounds
laid down above, we have a right to assume this
to be a <cite>voice of God</cite> as well. And so too, with
respect to the existence of a First Cause, Creator
and Upholder of all things, the universal consent
and conviction of all people, the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">consensus gentium</cite>,
must be considered of itself a mighty evidence in
its favour; a testimony which God is pleased to
render to Himself through his creatures. This
man or that, this generation or the other, might be
deceived, but all men and all generations could
not; the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</cite> makes itself felt as a <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox Dei</cite>.
The existence here and there of an atheist no more
disturbs our conclusion that it is of the essence
of man’s nature to believe in a God, than do
such monstrous births as from time to time
find place, children with two heads or with no
arms, shake our assurance that it is the normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
condition of man to have one head and two
arms.</p>

<p>This last is one of the proverbs which may be
said to belong to the Apology for Natural Religion.
There are others, of which it would not be far-fetched
to affirm that they belong to the Apology
for Revealed. Thus it was very usual with
Voltaire and other infidels of his time to appeal
to the present barrenness and desolation of Palestine,
in proof that it could never have supported
the vast population which the Scripture everywhere
assumes or affirms. A proverb in the
language of the arch-scoffer himself might, if he
had given heed to it, have put him on the right
track, had he wished to be put upon it, for understanding
how this could have been: <cite>As the man is
worth, his land is worth</cite>.<a name="Anchor-185" id="Anchor-185"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 185.">[185]</a> Man is lord of his
outward condition to a far greater extent than is
commonly assumed; even climate, which seems at
first sight so completely out of his reach, it is his
immensely to modify; and if nature stamps herself
on him, he stamps himself yet more powerfully on
nature. It is not a mere figure of speech, that of
the Psalmist, “A fruitful land maketh He barren
for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.”
(<abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> <abbr title="107">cvii.</abbr> 34.) God makes it barren, and ever less
capable of nourishing its inhabitants; but He makes
it so through the sloth, the indolence, the short-sightedness
of those that should have dressed and
kept it. In the condition of a land may be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the echo, the reflection, the transcript of the moral
and spiritual condition of those that should cultivate
it: where one is waste, the other will be
waste also. Under the desolating curse of Mohammedan
domination the fairest portions of the
earth have gone back from a garden to a wilderness:
but only let that people for whom Palestine
is yet destined return to it again, and return a
righteous nation, and in a little while all the
descriptions of its earlier fertility will be more than
borne out by its later, and it will easily sustain its
millions again.</p>

<div class="tbpara">
<p>How many proverbs, which cannot be affirmed
to have been originally made for the kingdom of
heaven, do yet in their highest fulfilment manifestly
belong to it, so that it seems as of right to claim
that for its own, even as it claims, or rather reclaims,
whatever else is good or true in the world, the
seeds of truth wherever dispersed abroad, as belonging
rightfully to itself. <span class="sidenote">Proverb of Pythagoras.</span>Thus there is that beautiful
proverb, of which Pythagoras is reputed the author:
<cite>The things of friends are in common</cite>.<a name="Anchor-186" id="Anchor-186"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 186.">[186]</a> Where
does this find its exhaustive fulfilment, but in the
communion of saints, their communion not with
one another merely, though indeed this is a part of
its fulfilment, but in their communion with Him,
who is the friend of all good men? That such a
conclusion lay legitimately in the words Socrates
plainly saw; who argued from it, that since good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
men were the friends of the gods, therefore whatever
things were the gods’, were also theirs; being,
when he thus concluded, as near as one who had
not the highest light of all, could be to that great
word of the Apostle’s, “All things are yours.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nor can I otherwise than esteem the ancient
proverb as a very fine one, and one which we may
gladly claim for our own: <cite>Many meet the gods,
but few salute them</cite>. How often do <em>the gods</em>, (for
I will keep in the language which this proverb
suggests and supplies,) <em>meet</em> men in the shape of a
sorrow which might be a purifying one, of a joy
which might elevate their hearts to thankfulness
and praise; in a sickness or a recovery, a disappointment
or a success; and yet how few, as it
must be sadly owned, <em>salute</em> them; how few recognise
their august presences in this joy or this
sorrow, this blessing added, or this blessing taken
away. As this proverb has reference to men’s
failing to <em>see</em> the Divine presences, so let me observe
by the way, there is a very grand French one
which expresses the same truth, under the image
of a failing to <em>hear</em> the divine voices, those voices
being drowned by the deafening hubbub of the
world: <cite>The noise is so great, one cannot hear
God thunder</cite>.<a name="Anchor-187" id="Anchor-187"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 187.">[187]</a></p>

<p>Here is another proverb which the Church has
long since claimed, at least in its import, for her
own: <cite>One man, no man</cite>.<a name="Anchor-188" id="Anchor-188"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 188.">[188]</a> I should find it very
hard indeed to persuade myself that whoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
uttered it first, attached to it no deeper meaning
than Erasmus gives him credit for&mdash;namely, that
nothing important can be effected by a single man,
destitute of the help of his fellows.<a name="Anchor-189" id="Anchor-189"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 189.">[189]</a> The word is
a far more profound one than this, and rests on
that great truth upon which the deeper thinkers
of antiquity laid so much stress&mdash;namely, that <em>in
the idea</em> the state precedes the individual, man
not being merely accidentally <em>gregarious</em>, but
essentially <em>social</em>. The solitary man, it would say,
is a monstrous conception, so utterly maimed and
crippled must he be; the condition of solitariness
involving so entire a suppression of all which belongs
to the development of that wherein the true
idea of humanity resides, of all which differences
man from the beasts of the field; and <span class="sidenote">One man, no man</span> in this sense
<cite>One man</cite> is <cite>no man</cite>; and this, I am sure, the proverb
from the first intended. Nor may we stop
here. This word is capable of, and seems to
demand, a still higher application to man, as a
destined member of the kingdom of heaven. But
he can only be in training for this, when he is,
and regards himself, as not alone, but the member
of a family. As <em>one man</em> he is <em>no man</em>; and the
strength and value of what is called Church
teaching is greatly this, that it does recognise and
realize this fact, that it contemplates and deals
with the faithful man, not as isolated, but as one
of an organic body, with duties which flow as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
moral necessities from his position therein; rather
than by himself, and as one whose duties to others
are indeed only the exercise of private graces for
his own benefit. And all that are called Church
doctrines, when they really understand themselves,
have their root and their real strength in that
great truth which this proverb declares, that <cite>One
man is no man</cite>, that only in a fellowship and communion
is or can any man be aught.</p>

<p>And then there is another proverb, which Plato
so loved to quote against the sophists, the men who
flattered and corrupted the nobler youth of Athens,
promising to impart to them easy short cuts to the
attainment of wisdom and knowledge and philosophy;
and this, without demanding the exercise
of any labour or patience or self-denial on their
parts. But with the proverb, <cite>Good things are
hard</cite>,<a name="Anchor-190" id="Anchor-190"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 190.">[190]</a> he continually rebuked their empty pretensions;
with this he made at least suspicious their
promises; and this proverb, true in the sense
wherein Plato used it, and that sense was earnest
and serious enough, yet surely reappears, glorified
and transfigured, but recognisable still, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Saviour’s words: “The kingdom of heaven is
taken by violence, and the violent take it by
force.”<a name="Anchor-191" id="Anchor-191"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 191.">[191]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Witnesses for the truth.</div>
<p>This method of looking in proverbs for an higher
meaning than any which lies on their surface, or
which they seem to bear on their fronts; or rather of
searching out their highest intention, and claiming
that as their truest, even though it should not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that perceived in them by most, or that which lay
nearest to them at their first generation, is one
that will lead us in many interesting paths. And
it is not merely those of heathen antiquity which
shall thus be persuaded often, and that without
any forcing, to render up a Christian meaning;
but (as was indeed to be expected) still more often
those of a later time, even those which the world
had seemed to claim for its own, shall be found to
move in a spiritual sphere as their truest. Let
me offer in evidence of this these four or five,
which come to us from Italy: <cite>He who has love in
his heart, has spurs in his sides</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Love rules
without law</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Love rules his kingdom without a
sword</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Love knows nothing of labour</cite>;&mdash;<cite>Love is
the master of all arts</cite>.<a name="Anchor-192" id="Anchor-192"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 192.">[192]</a> Take these, even with
the necessary drawbacks of my English translation;
but still more, in their original beauty; and
how exquisitely do they set forth, in whatever
light you regard them, the free creative impulses
of love, its delight to labour and to serve; how
worthily do they glorify the kingdom of love as
the only kingdom of a free and joyful obedience.
While yet at the same time, if we would appreciate
them at <em>all</em> their worth, is it possible to stop
short of an application of them to that kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of love, which, because it is in the highest sense
such, is also a kingdom of heaven? And then,
what precious witness do these utterances contain,
the more precious as current among a people
nursed in the theology of Rome, against the
shameless assertion that selfishness is the only
motive sufficient to produce good (?) works: for in
such an assertion the Romish impugners of a free
justification constantly deal; evermore charging
this that we hold, of our justification by faith only,
(which, when translated into the language of ethics,
is at least as important in the province of morality
as it is in that of theology,) with being an immoral
doctrine, and not so fruitful in deeds of love as one
which should connect these deeds with a selfish
thought of promoting our own safety thereby.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Christian proverbs.</div>
<p>There are proverbs which reach the height of
evangelical morality. “Little gospels”<a name="Anchor-193" id="Anchor-193"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 193.">[193]</a> the Spaniard
has somewhat too boldly entitled his; and certainly
there are many which at once we feel could nowhere
have arisen or obtained circulation but under
the influence of Christian faith, being in spirit, and
often in form no less than in spirit, the outbirths
of it. Thus is it with that exquisitely beautiful
proverb of our own: <cite>The way to heaven is by
Weeping-Cross</cite>;<a name="Anchor-194" id="Anchor-194"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 194.">[194]</a> nor otherwise with the Spanish:
<cite>God never wounds with both hands</cite>;<a name="Anchor-195" id="Anchor-195"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 195.">[195]</a> not with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
<em>both</em>, for He ever reserves one with which to bind
up and to heal. And another Spanish, evidently
intended to give the sum and substance of all
which in life is to be desired the most, <cite>Peace and
patience, and death with penitence</cite>,<a name="Anchor-196" id="Anchor-196"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 196.">[196]</a> gives this
sum certainly only as it presents itself to the Christian
eye. And this of ours is Christian both in
form and in spirit: <cite>Every cross hath its inscription</cite>;&mdash;the
name, that is, inscribed upon it, of the
person for whom it was shaped; it was intended
for those shoulders upon which it is laid, and will
adapt itself to them; that fearful word is never
true which a spirit greatly vexed spake in the hour
of its impatience: “I have little faith in the paternal
love which I need; so ruthless, or so negligent
seems the government of this earth.”<a name="Anchor-197" id="Anchor-197"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 197.">[197]</a></p>

<p>So too is it with that ancient German proverb:
<cite>When God loathes aught, men presently loathe it
too</cite>.<a name="Anchor-198" id="Anchor-198"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 198.">[198]</a> He who first uttered this must have been
one who had watched long the ways by which
shame and honour travel in this world; and in this
watching must have noted how it ever came to
pass that even worldly honour tarried not long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
with them from whom the true honour which
cometh from God had departed. For the worldly
honour is but a shadow and reflex that waits upon
the heavenly; it may indeed linger for a little, but
it will be only for a little, after it is divorced from
its substance. Where the honour from Him has
been withdrawn, he causes in one way or another
the honour from men ere long to be withdrawn
too. When He loathes, presently man loathes also.
The saltless salt is not merely cast out by Him,
but is trodden under foot of <em>men</em>. (<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> <abbr title="5">v.</abbr> 13.)

<div class="sidenote">Sir Matthew Hale’s proverb.</div>
<p>We are told of the good Sir Matthew Hale who
was animated with a true zeal for holiness, an
earnest desire to walk close to God, that he had
continually in his mouth the modern Latin proverb,
<cite>We perish by permitted things</cite>.<a name="Anchor-200" id="Anchor-200"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 200.">[200]</a> Assuredly it is
one very well worthy to be of all remembered,
searching as it does into the innermost secrets of
men’s lives. It is no doubt true that nearly as
much danger threatens the soul from things permitted
as from things unpermitted; in some respects
more danger; for these being disallowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
altogether, do not make the insidious approaches
of those, which, coming in under allowance, do yet
so easily slip into dangerous excess.</p>

<div class="tbpara">
<div class="sidenote">Proverbs and Scripture.</div>
<p>It would be interesting to collect, as with reverence
one might, variations on scriptural proverbs
or sayings, which the proverbs of this world supply;
and this, both in those cases where the latter have
grown out of the former, owing more nearly or
more remotely their existence to them, and in
those also where they are independent of them,&mdash;so
far, that is, as anything true can be independent of
the absolute Truth. Some of those which follow
evidently belong to one of these classes, some to
the other. Thus Solomon has said: “It is better
to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a
brawling woman in a wide house;” (<abbr title="Proverbs">Prov.</abbr> <abbr title="21">xxi.</abbr> 9;)
and again: “Better a dry morsel and quietness
therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with
strife.” (<abbr title="Proverbs">Prov.</abbr> <abbr title="17">xvii.</abbr> 1.) With these compare the
two proverbs, a Latin and Spanish, adduced below.<a name="Anchor-201" id="Anchor-201"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 201.">[201]</a>
The Psalmist has said: “As he loved cursing, so
let it come unto him.” (<abbr title="Psalms">Ps.</abbr> <abbr title="109">cix.</abbr> 17.) The Turks
express their faith in this same law of the divine
retaliations: <cite>Curses, like chickens, always come
home to roost</cite>; they return, that is, to those from
whom they went forth, while in the Yoruba language
there is a proverb to the same effect: <cite>Ashes always
fly back in the face of him that throws them</cite>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
while our own, <cite>Harm watch, harm catch</cite>, and the
Spanish, <cite>Who sows thorns, let him not walk barefoot</cite>,<a name="Anchor-202" id="Anchor-202"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 202.">[202]</a>
are utterances of very nearly the same conviction.
Our Lord declares, that without his Father
there falls no single sparrow to the ground, that
“not one of them is forgotten before God.” (Luke
<abbr title="12">xii.</abbr> 6.) The same truth of a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">providentia specialissima</em>,
(between which and no providence at all
there is indeed no tenable position,) is asserted in
the Catalan proverb: <cite>No leaf moves, but God wills
it</cite>.<a name="Anchor-203" id="Anchor-203"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 203.">[203]</a> Again, He has said: “No man can serve two
masters.” (<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> <abbr title="6">vi.</abbr> 24.) And the Spanish proverb:
<cite>He who must serve two masters, must lie to one</cite>.<a name="Anchor-204" id="Anchor-204"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 204.">[204]</a>
Or compare with <abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> <abbr title="19">xix.</abbr> 29, this remarkable
Arabic proverb: <cite>Purchase the next world with
this; so shalt thou win both</cite>. He has spoken of
“mammon of unrighteousness”&mdash;indicating hereby,
in Leighton’s words, “that iniquity is so involved
in the notion of riches, that it can very hardly be
separated from them;” and this phrase Jerome
illustrates by a proverb that would not otherwise
have reached us; “that saying,” he says, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>“appears
true to me: <cite>A rich man is either himself an unjust
one, or the heir of one</cite>.”<a name="Anchor-205" id="Anchor-205"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 205.">[205]</a> Again, the Lord has said:
“Many be called, but few chosen;” (<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> <abbr title="20">xx.</abbr> 16;)
many have the outward marks of a Christian profession,
few the inner substance. Some early Christian
Fathers loved much to bring into comparison
with this a Greek proverb, spoken indeed quite
independently of it, and long previously; and the
parallel certainly is a singularly happy one: <cite>The
thyrsus-bearers are many, but the bacchants few</cite>;<a name="Anchor-206" id="Anchor-206"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 206.">[206]</a>
many assume the signs and outward tokens of
inspiration, whirling the thyrsus aloft; but those
whom the god indeed fills with his spirit are few
all the while.<a name="Anchor-207" id="Anchor-207"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 207.">[207]</a> With our Lord’s words concerning
the mote and the beam (<abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr> <abbr title="7">vii.</abbr> 3, 5) compare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
this Chinese proverb: <cite>Sweep away the snow from
thine own door, and heed not the frost upon thy
neighbour’s tiles</cite>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs in sermons.</div>
<p>It has been sometimes a matter of consideration
to me whether we of the clergy might not make
larger use, though of course it would be only
occasional, of proverbs in our public teaching than
we do. Great popular preachers of time past, or,
seeing that this phrase has now so questionable a
sound, great preachers for the people, such as have
found their way to the universal heart of their
fellows, addressing themselves not to that which
some men had different from others, but to that
rather which each had in common with all, have
been ever great employers of proverbs. Thus he
who would know the riches of those in the German
tongue, with the vigorous manifold employment of
which they are capable, will find no richer mine
to dig in than the works of Luther. And such
employment of them would, I believe, with our
country congregations, be especially valuable. Any
one, who by after investigation has sought to discover
how much our rustic hearers carry away,
even from the sermons to which they have attentively
listened, will find that it is hardly ever the
course and tenor of the argument, supposing the
discourse to have contained such; but if anything
was uttered, as it used so often to be by the best
puritan preachers, tersely, pointedly, epigrammatically,
this will have stayed by them, while all
beside has passed away. Now, the merits of terseness
and point, which have caused other words to
be remembered, are exactly those which signalize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the proverb, and generally in a yet higher
degree.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be observed, that, if thus used,
they will have to be employed with prudence and
discretion, and with a careful selection. Thus, even
with the example of so grave a divine as Bishop
Sanderson before me, I should hesitate to employ
in a sermon such a proverb as <cite>Over shoes, over
boots</cite>&mdash;one which he declares to be the motto of
some, who having advanced a certain way in sin,
presently become utterly wretchless, caring not, and
counting it wholly indifferent, how much further in
evil they advance. Nor would I exactly recommend
such use of a proverb as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bernard makes,
who, in a sermon on the angels, desiring to shew
<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</cite> the extreme probability of their active
and loving ministries in the service of men, adduces
the Latin proverb: <cite>Who loves me, loves my
dog</cite>;<a name="Anchor-208" id="Anchor-208"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 208.">[208]</a> and proceeds to argue thus; We are the
dogs under Christ’s table; the angels love Him,
they therefore love us.</p>

<p>But, although not exactly thus, the thing, I am
persuaded, might be done, and with profit. Thus,
in a discourse warning against sins of the tongue,
there are many words which we might produce of
our own to describe the mischief it inflicts that
would be flatter, duller, less likely to be remembered
than the old proverb: <cite>The tongue is not steel,
but it cuts</cite>. On God’s faithfulness in sustaining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
upholding, rewarding his servants, there are feebler
things which we might bring out of our own
treasure-house, than to remind our hearers of that
word: <cite>He who serves God, serves a good Master</cite>.
And this one might sink deep, telling of the enemy
whom every one of us has the most to fear: <cite>No
man has a worse friend than he brings with him
from home</cite>. It stands in striking agreement with
Augustine’s remarkable prayer “Deliver me from
the evil man, from myself.”<a name="Anchor-209" id="Anchor-209"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 209.">[209]</a> Or again: <cite>Ill weeds
grow apace</cite>;&mdash;with how lively an image does this
set forth to us the rank luxuriant up-growth of
sinful lusts and desires in the garden of an uncared-for,
untended heart. I know not whether we might
presume sufficient quickness of apprehension on the
part of our hearers to venture on the following: <cite>The
horse which draws its halter is not quite escaped</cite>;
but I can hardly imagine an happier illustration of
the fact, that so long as any remnant of a sinful
habit is retained by us, so long as we draw this
halter, we make but an idle boast of our liberty;
we may, by means of that which we still drag with
us, be at any moment again entangled altogether
in the bondage from which we seemed to have
entirely escaped.</p>

<p>In every language some of its noblest proverbs,
such as oftentimes are admirably adapted for this
application of which I am speaking, are those embodying
men’s confidence in God’s moral government
of the world, in his avenging righteousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
however much there may be in the confusions of
the present evil time to provoke a doubt or even
a denial of this. Thus, <cite>Punishment is lame, but
it comes</cite>, which, if not old, yet rests on an image
derived from antiquity, is good; although inferior
in every way, in energy of expression, as in fulness
of sense, to the ancient Greek one: <cite>The mill of
God grinds late, but grinds to powder</cite>;<a name="Anchor-210" id="Anchor-210"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 210.">[210]</a> for this
brings in the further thought, that his judgments,
however long they tarry, yet, when they arrive, are
crushing ones. There is indeed another of our own,
not unworthy to be set beside this, announcing,
though with quite another image, the same fact of
the tardy but terrible arrivals of judgment: <cite>God
comes with leaden feet, but strikes with iron hands</cite>.
And then, how awfully sublime another which has
come down to us as part of the wisdom of the
ancient heathen world; I mean the following: <cite>The
feet of the (avenging) deities are shod with wool</cite>.<a name="Anchor-211" id="Anchor-211"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 211.">[211]</a>
Here a new thought is introduced,&mdash;the noiseless
approach and advance of these judgments, as noiseless
as the steps of one whose feet were wrapped
in wool,&mdash;the manner in which they overtake
secure sinners even in the hour of their utmost
security. Who that has studied the history of the
great crimes and criminals of the world, but will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
with a shuddering awe set his seal to the truth of
this proverb? Indeed, meditating on such and
on the source from which we have derived them,
one is sometimes tempted to believe that the faith
in a divine retribution evermore making itself
felt in the world, this sense of a Nemesis, as men
used to call it, was stronger and deeper in the
earlier and better days of heathendom, than alas!
it is in a sunken Christendom now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proverbs not profane.</div>
<p>But to resume. Even those proverbs which have
acquired an use which seems to unite at once the
trivial and the profane, may yet on closer inspection
be found to be very far from having either
triviality or profaneness cleaving to them. There
is one, for instance, often taken lightly enough
upon the lips: <cite>Talk of the devil, and he is sure to
appear</cite>; or as it used to be: <cite>Talk of the devil, and
his imps will appear</cite>; or as in German it is:
<cite>Paint the devil on the wall, and he will shew himself
anon</cite>;&mdash;which yet contains truth serious and
important enough, if we would only give heed to
it: it contains, in fact, a very solemn warning
against a very dangerous sin, I mean, curiosity
about evil. It has been often noticed, and is a
very curious psychological fact, that there is a
tendency in a great crime to reproduce itself, to
call forth, that is, other crimes of the same character:
and there is a fearful response which the
evil we may hear or read about, is in danger of
finding in our own hearts. This danger, then,
assuredly makes it true wisdom, and a piece of
moral prudence on the part of all to whom this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
permitted, to avoid knowing or learning about the
evil; especially when neither duty nor necessity
oblige them thereto. It is men’s wisdom to talk
as little about the devil, either with themselves or
with others, as they can; lest he appear to them.
“I agree with you,” says Niebuhr very profoundly
in one of his letters,<a name="Anchor-212" id="Anchor-212"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 212.">[212]</a> “that it is better not to read
books in which you make the acquaintance of the
devil.” And certainly there is a remarkable commentary
on this proverb, so interpreted, in the
earnest warning given to the children of Israel,
that they should not so much as <em>inquire</em> how the
nations which were before them in Canaan, served
their gods, with what cruelties, with what abominable
impurities, lest through this inquiry they
should be themselves entangled in the same. (<abbr title= "Deuteronomy">Deut.</abbr>
<abbr title="12">xii.</abbr> 29, 30.) They were not to talk about the devil,
lest he should appear to them.</p>

<p>And other proverbs, too, which at first sight
may seem over-familiar with the name of the great
enemy of mankind, yet contain lessons which it
would be an infinite pity to lose; as this German:
<cite>Where the devil cannot come, he will send</cite>;<a name="Anchor-213" id="Anchor-213"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 213.">[213]</a> a
proverb of very serious import, which excellently
sets out to us the <em>penetrative</em> character of temptations,
and the certainty that they will follow and
find men out in their secretest retreats. It rebukes
the absurdity of supposing that by any outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
arrangements, cloistral retirements, flights into the
wilderness, sin can be kept at a distance. So far
from this, temptations will inevitably overleap all
these outward and merely artificial barriers which
may be raised up against them; for our great
enemy is as formidable from a seeming distance as
in close combat; <cite>where he cannot come, he will
send</cite>. There are others of the same family, as the
following: <cite>The devil’s meal is half bran</cite>; or <cite>all
bran</cite>, as the Italians still more boldly proclaim it;<a name="Anchor-214" id="Anchor-214"></a>
<a href="#Footnote-214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 214.">[214]</a>
unrighteous gains are sure to disappoint the getter;
the pleasures of sin, even in this present time, are
largely dashed with its pains. And this: <cite>He had
need of a long spoon that eats with the devil</cite>;&mdash;men
fancy they can cheat the arch-cheater, can
advance in partnership with him up to a certain
point, and then, whenever the connexion becomes
too dangerous, break it off at their will; being sure
in this to be miserably deceived; for, to quote
another in the same tone: <cite>He who has shipped
the devil, must carry him over the water</cite>. Granting
these and the like to have been often carelessly
uttered, yet they all rest upon a true moral basis
in the main. This last series of proverbs I will
close with an Arabic one, to which not even this
appearance of levity can be ascribed; for it is as
solemn and sublime in form as it is profoundly deep
in substance: <cite>The blessings of the evil Genii are
curses</cite>. How deep a meaning the story of Fortunatus
acquires, when taken as a commentary on this.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>But I am warned to draw my lecture to an end.
I have adduced in the course of these lectures
no inconsiderable number of proverbs, and have
sought for the most part to deduce from them
lessons, which were lessons in common for us all.
There is one, however, which I must not pass over,
for I feel that it contains an especial lesson for
myself, and a lesson which I should do wisely and
well at this present time to lay to heart. When
the Spaniards would describe a tedious writer, one
who possesses the art of exhausting the patience of
his readers, they say of him: <cite>He leaves nothing
in his inkstand</cite>. The phrase is a singularly
happy one, for assuredly there is no such secret of
tediousness, no such certain means of wearing out
the attention of our readers or our hearers, as the
attempt to say everything ourselves, instead of
leaving something to be filled up by their intelligence;
while the merits of a composition are
often displayed as really, if not so prominently, in
what is passed over as in what is set down; in
nothing more than in the just measure of the confidence
which it shows in the capacities and powers
of those to whom it is addressed. I would not
willingly come under the condemnation, which
waits on them who thus <cite>leave nothing in their
inkstand</cite>; and lest I should do so, I will bring now
this my final lecture to its close, and ask you to
draw out for yourselves those further lessons from
proverbs, which I am sure they are abundantly
capable of yielding.</p>

The deepening of a proverb’s use among Christian
nations as compared with earlier applications of the same
may be illustrated by an example, which however, as
not being directly theological, and thus not bearing immediately
upon the matter in hand, I shall prefer to append
in a note. An old Greek and Latin proverb, <cite>A great city,
a great solitude</cite>, (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna civitas, magna solitudo</span>,) seems
to have dwelt merely on the outside of things, and to have
meant no more than this, namely, that a city ambitiously
laid out and upon a large scheme would with difficulty
find inhabitants sufficient, would wear an appearance of
emptiness and desolation; as there used to be a jest about
Washington, that strangers would sometimes imagine
themselves deep in the woods, when indeed they were in
the centre of the city. But with deeper cravings of the
human heart after love and affection, the proverb was
claimed in an higher sense. We may take in proof these
striking words of De Quincey, which are the more striking
that neither they nor the context contain any direct reference
to the proverb: “No man,” he says, “ever was
left to himself for the first time in the streets, as yet unknown,
of London, but he must have felt saddened and
mortified, perhaps terrified, by the sense of desertion and
utter loneliness which belongs to his situation. No loneliness
can be like that which weighs upon the heart in the
centre of faces never ending, without voice or utterance
for him; eyes innumerable that have ‘no speculation’ in
their orbs which <em>he</em> can understand; and hurrying figures
of men and women weaving to and fro, with no apparent
purposes intelligible to a stranger, seeming like a masque
of maniacs, or a pageant of shadowy illusions.” A direct
reference to the proverb is to be found in some affecting
words of Lord Bacon, who glosses and explains it exactly
in this sense;&mdash;“For a crowd is not company, and faces
are but a gallery of pictures, and talk but a tinkling
cymbal, where there is no love.”</p></li>

The fact which this proverb proclaims, of a great gulf
existing between what men profess and what they are, is
one too frequently repeating itself and thrusting itself on
the notice of all, not to have found its utterance in an infinite
variety of forms, although none perhaps so deep and
poetical as this. Thus there is another Greek line, fairly
represented by this Latin:</p>

<div class="verse"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui tauros stimulent multi, sed rarus arator</span>;</div>

<p>and there is the classical Roman proverb: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non omnes qui
habent citharam, sunt citharœdi</span>; and the medieval rhyming
verse:</p>

<span class="stitle">ON THE METRICAL LATIN PROVERBS OF THE MIDDLE AGES. (See <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_29" title="Go to page 29.">29</a>.)</span></h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upcase">I have</span> not seen anywhere brought together a collection
of these medieval proverbs cast into the
form of a rhyming hexameter. Erasmus, though he
often illustrates the proverbs of the ancient world by
those of the new, does not quote, as far as I am aware,
through the whole of his enormous collection, a single
one of these which occupy a middle place between the
two; a fact which in its way is curiously illustrative
of the degree to which the attention of the great
Humanists at the revival of learning was exclusively
directed to the classical literature of Greece and Rome.
Yet proverbs in this form exist in considerable number;
being of very various degrees of merit, as will be
seen from the following selection; in which some are
keen and piquant enough, while others are of very
subordinate value; those which seemed to me utterly
valueless&mdash;and they were not few&mdash;I have excluded
altogether. The reader familiar with proverbs will
detect correspondents to very many of them, besides
the few which I have quoted, in one modern language
or another, often in many.</p>

<p>Let me observe here, once for all, that the lengthening of
the final syllable in <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">capê</em>, is not to be set down to the ignorance
or carelessness of the writer; but in the theory of
the medieval hexameter, the unavoidable stress or pause
on the first syllable of the third foot was counted sufficient
to lengthen the shortest syllable in that position.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
